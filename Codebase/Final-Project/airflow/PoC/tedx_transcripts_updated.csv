Levy,How scientists are creating real-life invisibility cloaks,https://www.ted.com/talks/max_g_levy_how_scientists_are_creating_real_life_invisibility_cloaks,"A spy presses a button on their suit and blinks out of sight. A wizard wraps himself in a cloak and disappears limb by limb. A star pilot flicks a switch and their ship vanishes into space. Invisibility is one of the most tantalizing powers in fiction, spanning all kinds of stories. But could this fantasy ever become a reality? Well, invisibility is a relative term. Researchers and engineers working in stealth technology have developed planes nearly undetectable to radar, and cloaks that conceal tanks from thermal cameras. But these innovations don&apos;t make things invisible to the human eye. Our eyes see by taking in the visible light waves that reflect off objects. So to make an object invisible without turning off the lights, our eyes would need to see the light from behind that object, rather than the light bouncing off the object itself. And to do that, we need to be able to control these visible light waves. One way to do this is through reflection. This method is predictable, but it requires maintaining angles too precise for most moving targets. Researchers can also absorb light with ultra-black surfaces covered in light-capturing nanotubes, but painting something black doesn’t exactly make it invisible. So instead, many researchers are trying to reroute wavelengths around an object using refraction. Refraction describes how light changes direction when it passes between materials of differing density. When light passes from a less dense medium into a denser one, its path gets slightly bent. Consider how someone’s legs look when you sit at the edge of a pool. Since water is denser than air, the light waves reflecting from the water to your eyes speed up and bend. In nature, this effect has limits. Even when passing through natural materials with the highest refractive indexes, light can only bend so far. But in the lab, we can shatter those limits. In the 1990s, theoretical physicist John Pendry was working with a defense lab to create a way to absorb radar signals. The result was a mesh of carbon fibers so thin and densely woven that they interacted with light in an entirely different way from regular carbon. This inspired Pendry to try similar tricks with other materials. By altering them at the microscopic level, Pendry could add tiny microstructures capable of capturing and bending light in ways previously thought impossible. He called this technology metamaterials and developed his most famous example: a split ring resonator— a metamaterial structure which allowed him to bend light past the theorized limit. The discovery of negative refraction kicked off the modern wave of invisibility research. To date, labs have designed metamaterials that can completely steer away microwaves. But a true invisibility cloak would need to bend all wavelengths of visible light simultaneously and without distortion, and refraction doesn’t treat all wavelengths equally. Consider how refractive materials produce rainbows with varying colors. Despite leading the field, metamaterials aren&apos;t the only route toward invisibility. One lab was able to create a controlled desert mirage using hot air just above the ground to refract light from the cooler air around it  to create distortions and illusions. Unfortunately, this model only operates at thousands of degrees. Another lab created a unique configuration of glass lenses which can bend the light around an object within a ring-shaped area in the lens. This lens could be made large enough to obscure an entire person, but its effect only works when both the observer and the obscured stand in the exact right positions. And attempts using cameras to record environments and project them over a cloak have been hindered by lag and color distortion. These efforts, and many more, still have a ways to go towards bringing this magical technology to life. But if one thing is true about science, it’s that the limitations we see today could simply disappear."

548518,lily_yeh_how_art_transforms_brokenness_into_beauty,Lily Yeh,How art transforms brokenness into beauty,https://www.ted.com/talks/lily_yeh_how_art_transforms_brokenness_into_beauty,"I remember when I was young, I liked to make pictures of beautiful places, but I didn&apos;t know that would become the passion of my life. I was born in China and grew up in Taiwan. When I was seven, my family had to flee to the island because of the communist takeover of the mainland. And at 15, I began studying Chinese landscape painting. And through the studies, I came in contact with a very special place, which is often described as the “Dustless World” in Chinese culture. It is a place of this world, yet it reveals the mystery of the other. It is a place of pristine beauty and poignant serenity, without the mental pollution of self-centeredness and greed and ignorance. And eventually it&apos;s a place I call home. Upon graduation from college, like many people of my generation in Taiwan, we left because of tight political control then and also the desire for further education abroad. And so I came to the States to study art and stayed ever after in the country. Then when I received my MFA, I had a busy and flourishing life for some time. I had a family and I became a full professor and I exhibited in fine galleries. And yet I felt something essential missing in my life. Then I met Arthur Hall, a preeminent dancer and choreographer, and he invited me to do a project in an abandoned lot next to his headquarters in an inner city neighborhood in North Philadelphia. And to tell you the truth, at the beginning I was so afraid. And actually, I wanted to run away. What could a little Chinese woman do in this neighborhood, basically overtaken by poverty, crime and violence? Then the little voice in me spoke, and it says, &quot;You must rise to the occasion. Otherwise the light in you will die.&quot; And so I began small. At the beginning, only children came to help. They were attracted by the spades and brooms and shovels that we set up. And slowly, with donated materials, found materials, we began to make murals and sculptures and mosaics. And children’s laughter and joy were infectious and gradually drew in adults. And see, that&apos;s how we set the baits to lure people in. (Laughter) And then everybody became happy. Over the years, we created a series of parks and gardens ... (Applause) ... tree farm, a performing arts program, festivals and rites of passage program, and many more. And eventually, the little summer art project evolved into a nonprofit arts organization called the Village of Arts and Humanities. What was surprising to me was that what the world found broken in this community actually is a treasure land full of resources, energy, talent and creativity. And through working with people, I found what was missing in my life. I knew I had to leave my tenured professorship in order to step into my life, and the wisdom, compassion and endurance of the community guided me home to the Dustless World, that wonderful place of enchantment and profound beauty. I stayed at the Village for 18 years, then I felt the calling to bring what I have learned at the Village to places in need in the world. I established another organization called the Barefoot Artists. Then in 2004, I met Jean Bosco Musana from Rwanda in a conference in Barcelona. We began working together right away until now. Upon my first visit, he took me to see the genocide memorial near his city, Gisenyi. And the site looked so forsaken and forlorn, I wanted to help. Then one thing led to the other. First was the design. And then the children. And then adults came. And then a construction team. And then a series of mosaic workshops. And then the completion of the genocide memorial. (Applause) And here I want to express my deep gratitude to the survivors and their families who participated in the project despite their deep grief. And also to the China Road and Bridge Construction Company and its team, whose help was essential in converting my design into reality. Then, in early spring of 2007, we dedicated the memorial to the people and the government for its safekeeping. Then April 7, the day of national mourning, and thousands of people walk in silence for miles to the site. Then they would line up and descend into the bone chamber. And that&apos;s where they mourn their dead. A survivor told me that our loved ones can come home now in dignity. When we see beauty, we see hope. I wanted to work with the migrant community in the countryside in China for some time, and in 2006, I was lucky enough to join Dandelion Middle School. Its purpose is to serve the most vulnerable, the children of migrant workers. As you can see, the school was converted from an abandoned factory, and it looks basic and bare and rustic. But then it&apos;s a perfect place for me and the school community to turn dilapidation into color and abundance. (Applause) And through the process, we had such fun, and we have learned so much. Fifteen years later, facing demolition, the school relocated and the new place is grand and modern, but cold and harsh. And so students felt estranged and unhappy. So I stepped in and created the design that is reminiscent of the gentleness in the old school. And together again, with the students and teachers, we brought color, joy and intimacy to this new setting. During COVID, I created this design, the rainbow and  the tree of life for Dandelion. Just last fall, in a period of 59 days, and with the participation of 913 teachers, students and volunteers with our unskilled hands but with utter dedication, together we made something beyond our own expectation and something magical. And then the process, when the day is finished and we become drunk with the exaltation and happiness and the process -- (Applause) and the process unified us into one. What a deep experience. And over the years, I have come to see myself as a barefoot artist. My method is very simple. I have a bag full of art supplies, and I would go to places in need and work with whoever come and join me. Together we play and create. And over the different projects and experiences, I come to realize that broken places are my canvases and people&apos;s stories the palette and the people&apos;s imagination and talent and the tools for new inventions. Together we envision and transform. And I also come to realize a fundamental truth: people need beauty. Not the superficial beauty, but the profound and transformative beauty. It is like fire in a dark winter&apos;s night. It is the beauty that our soul yearns for. Our world is so broken today with the violent wars ... with massive extinction of species and profound, profound human suffering. And we need this vision and energy to beauty now more than ever. May we rise to embrace the broken. When [we] act together, I know we will have the power to transform, far and wide, the brokenness into beauty. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"
555215,vidhya_ramalingam_the_real_world_danger_of_online_myths,Vidhya Ramalingam,The real-world danger of online myths,https://www.ted.com/talks/vidhya_ramalingam_the_real_world_danger_of_online_myths,"&quot;You are a disgusting liar.&quot; &quot;Someone, somewhere will hunt you down.&quot; &quot;I hope someone puts a bullet between your eyes.&quot; These are messages received by climate scientists. According to a recent survey, 39 percent of climate scientists have faced online abuse. 18 percent of those are threats of physical violence. &quot;At the end of the day, we&apos;re going to see just how much you believe in your global warming and whether you&apos;re willing to die for your so-called &apos;research.&apos;&quot; No scientist should have to fear for their lives. But this is just another day in the life of a climate scientist. I&apos;m not a climate scientist. I&apos;m not a climate change activist. I&apos;m a counterterrorism expert. I started my journey meeting with white supremacists in basements in Sweden and went on to lead a global policy effort after Europe&apos;s first major terrorist attack perpetrated by a white supremacist. I went on to found Moonshot, an organization that works to end violence online. I care about climate change denial because it&apos;s so often weaponized to serve as a justification for violence. It would be easy to think that if only we could get people to understand climate change is real, we could put an end to this. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not that simple. In 2019, a gunman walked into a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. He killed 23 people, many of immigrant background. He called himself an “ecofascist.” He believed in climate change, but he had bought into mis- and disinformation that immigrants were the root cause of it, that sustainability would only be possible with the elimination of people of color. Mis- and disinformation are so often weaponized to serve as a justification for violence. Although they&apos;re often used interchangeably, misinformation is information that&apos;s false or misleading. Disinformation is spread intentionally to cause harm. It’s so powerful because it taps into your grievances, what makes you really angry, and it offers simplistic solutions. There&apos;s typically a villain and a hero. Over the last two years, my team and I have been researching different kinds of manipulation tactics used all over the world to spread disinformation. Two of the most common were decontextualization and fearmongering. Decontextualization is the practice of taking information out of its original context to deliberately mislead people. For example, earlier this year, Europe experienced a series of protests by farmers against a range of proposed environmental regulations. There were street blockades and protests, demonstrations, occupations. Adding to an already tense moment, several inauthentic images circulated. This one purported to show the Ukrainian embassy in Paris getting pummeled with manure. This was actually footage taken months earlier from an entirely different protest about an entirely different issue in Dijon, not even in Paris. And this effort to mislead the public, it wouldn&apos;t be complete without the use of new technology. Here&apos;s an image showing the streets of Paris lined with bales of hay. It&apos;s a really striking image, isn&apos;t it? This never happened. It was entirely generated by AI. And this isn&apos;t just happening in Europe. Last year, after wildfires raged in Hawaii, a disinformation network linked to the Chinese Communist Party spread inauthentic images purporting that the US government had intentionally spread the wildfires using a so-called “weather weapon.” Can you imagine? Over a hundred people died in those wildfires, and the idea that those fires were deliberately set by their own government against their own people? It&apos;s terrifying. These kinds of conspiratorial narratives can spread widespread fear, which takes us to the next powerful tactic of disinformation: fearmongering: deliberately exaggerating an issue so that you can provoke fear and alarm. We know that emotion-driven information processing can overtake evidence-based decision making, which is what makes this form of disinformation so effective. It&apos;s for these reasons that a recent MIT study found a false story will travel six times quicker to reach 1,500 people than a true story will. And we know Facebook fact-checkers take up to 72 hours on average to identify and remove this content. By that time, most impressions have already been made. Now I know we have all seen this online, and when you see it happen, it can be really tempting to respond with the facts. I get it. We pride ourselves on logic and science. The truth matters. So when someone is so obviously spreading false information, just correct them, right? Unfortunately, this doesn&apos;t always work. Believe me, I spent the last two decades learning how to have conversations with people buying into white supremacy. That is disinformation at its worst. Disinformation wins because of the emotions it inspires, because of the way it makes people feel. So if someone is so bought into disinformation, getting into debates on the facts with them can just risk pushing them even further into a corner, backing them into a corner so that they get really defensive. OK, so if we can&apos;t debate the facts endlessly, what can we do? Last year, Moonshot partnered with Google to test an approach known as “prebunking.” Prebunking is a proven communication technique designed to help people spot and reject efforts to manipulate them in the future by giving them forewarning and giving them tools to be able to reject a manipulative message, you lessen the likelihood that they will be misled. This is not about telling people what is true or false or right or wrong. It&apos;s about empowering people to protect themselves. We&apos;ve tapped into the universal human desire not to be manipulated, and this method has been tried and tested for decades, since the 1960s. All prebunking messages contain three essential ingredients. One: an emotional warning. You alert people that there are others out there who may be trying to mislead or manipulate them. Be aware, you may be targeted. Two: stimulus. You show people examples of manipulative messaging so that they will be more likely to be able to identify those in the future. And three: refutation. You give people the tools to be able to refute a message in real time. For example, if you see a headline that’s really sensational, and it either seems too good to be true or it makes you really angry, always Google around for other sources. Always Google around. OK, so we knew the steps to take, but we also knew if we were going to really get at this problem around the world, a one-size-fits-all approach wouldn&apos;t work. We knew we needed to get local. So we partnered with civil society organizations in countries around the world, from Germany to Indonesia to Ukraine. And we started first with the evidence. We met with dozens of experts, we surveyed the online space, and we identified the most common manipulation tactics being used in each country. We then partnered with local filmmakers to create educational videos that would teach people about those manipulation tactics that were being used in their home country. In some contexts, we found that people trust close peers and relatives the most. So in Germany, we filmed close friends chatting in a park. In Ukraine, we filmed family dialogues around a kitchen table, a setting that&apos;s so familiar to so many of us, where so many of us have had those difficult conversations. We wanted to encourage people to have these kinds of conversations within their own trusted circles, whether they&apos;re in El Salvador or Indonesia. And to do so before pivotal moments where online manipulation efforts intensify, like elections. So as we prepared to head into the EU elections, we knew that distrust in climate science had already emerged as a critical misinformation theme. Now one study had found that adults over the age of 45 are less likely to investigate false information when they stumble across it online. Now we also know that adults over the age of 45 have higher voter turnout, which means if it wins, disinformation can have a disproportionate impact on the outcomes of elections. So as we prepare to head into the EU elections, we created content for every EU country, in 27 languages, aiming to empower Europeans to spot and reject efforts to manipulate them before the elections. Over the last year, we have reached millions of people around the globe with these videos. In Germany alone, we reached 42 million people. That&apos;s half the German population. And we found on average, viewers of these videos were up to 10 percent more likely to be able to identify manipulation efforts than those who hadn&apos;t seen those videos. This is a winning formula. The evidence shows us that prebunking is effective at building resistance to disinformation. It begs the question, how do we make that resistance last? How do we build long-term societal resilience to disinformation efforts? There is an ongoing effort to use disinformation to undermine our democracies. Just last month, the US Justice Department seized 32 internet domains secretly deployed by the Russian government to spread disinformation across the US and Europe. This included deliberate efforts to exploit anxieties and fear across the public about the energy transition, specifically to encourage violence. Now it’s not just the Russian government that we need to be worried about. Easy access to generative AI tools means that anyone, not just those with resources, money and power, can create high-quality, effective, powerful disinformation content. And the sources of disinformation are varied. They can come from our elected officials all the way through to our neighbors down the road. Many of us don&apos;t need to look further than our own families. But so many of the tools we tested online are even more powerful when they come directly from the people that you trust and love the most in real life, IRL. So instead of endlessly debating the facts, give your loved ones the tools that they need to protect themselves online. Information manipulation is unfortunately the new norm. But that doesn&apos;t mean we need to accept our loved ones being misled, and we shouldn&apos;t accept our climate scientists living in fear. So if we can&apos;t fact-check our way out of this problem, we need to beat disinformation at its own game by reaching people before disinformation does and giving them all the tools that they need to protect themselves online. Thank you so much. (Applause)"
554289,emma_bryce_the_world_s_longest_burning_fires,Emma Bryce,The world’s longest-burning fires,https://www.ted.com/talks/emma_bryce_the_world_s_longest_burning_fires,"In 1997, a fire began in Indonesia that would rage for almost a year. It spanned several thousand square kilometers, halted numerous international flights, and spread an acrid haze all the way to China. Yet, despite being one of the largest fires in recorded history, for months at a time it burned without a flame— blazing on entirely underground. This might sound like a uniquely freaky fire, but each year, subterranean fires produce roughly 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions— that’s six times more than international aviation. And these burns are virtually unstoppable, earning them the ominous title of zombie fires. So, is it possible to snuff out these bizarre blazes? And how do they even form in the first place? A standard fire requires three ingredients: fuel, heat, and oxygen. Every fuel has what’s known as an ignition point— a temperature at which it begins to break down. This process, also known as pyrolysis, releases gaseous compounds that mix with nearby oxygen molecules to produce combustion. And it’s this chemical reaction that releases large amounts of heat and light in the form of flames. But not all combustion leads to flames. Pyrolysis leaves behind a solid material called char— like what’s found in charcoal. Char contains no combustible gases but it’s rich in highly flammable carbon. And under hot enough conditions, its surface reacts with the surrounding oxygen, creating a slow, glowing burn called smoldering. Instead of flame, this process releases smoke; specifically, smoke full of emissions like carbon monoxide, methane, and particulate matter.  All these factors come into play in zombie fires, which are more scientifically known as peat fires. Peat is a type of soil that forms when organic matter builds up more rapidly than it decomposes,  and it’s typically found in regions that are very cold or very wet— two factors that can slow down decomposition. When plants shed and die in peatland, the carbon they&apos;ve absorbed during their lifetime gets locked inside, making peatlands one of the planet&apos;s largest natural carbon stores. But just like char, that also makes this carbon-rich material extremely flammable. Historically, the moisture and cold temperatures of peatlands made them unlikely to catch fire. But today, droughts caused by climate change are drying out these landscapes worldwide, and other peatlands have been drained to make way for farms. Under these conditions,  a fire at the surface can more easily ignite the peat below, transforming it into char which will continue to smolder. As heat builds in the soil, it further dries the peat and eventually, deeper layers begin to burn. Peat fires are slow, creeping along at just one millimeter a minute. But what they lack in speed,  they make up for in persistence. These fires can burn for months or even years, all while spewing smoke full of poisonous gases. And since they show few signs of burning above ground, they’re incredibly difficult to track until they ignite dry surface soil, potentially miles away from the source. Zombie fires can even burn beneath snow-caked soil, overwintering until they spark new blazes in the spring. So how can we fight these fires? Well, dousing them with water is surprisingly tricky. Water&apos;s molecules form close bonds, resulting in a high surface tension that stops it from filtering evenly through burning peat. Researchers are experimenting with ways to reduce water’s surface tension,  allowing it to permeate the simmering soil. And some countries are trying to stop the fires before they start by running controlled burns in peatland habitats. But many others are simply working to prevent peatland drainage, which keeps these landscapes wet and resilient to fires. Despite accounting for only 3% of Earth&apos;s land, peatlands hold more than a quarter of the planet&apos;s carbon. And as climate change continues to increase the risk of extreme weather, including the droughts plaguing these landscapes, keeping that carbon out of the atmosphere has never been more important."
552753,molly_graham_forget_the_corporate_ladder_winners_take_risks,Molly Graham,Forget the corporate ladder — winners take risks,https://www.ted.com/talks/molly_graham_forget_the_corporate_ladder_winners_take_risks,"There&apos;s a lot of pressure around what it takes to build a great career. And it all comes back to this idea that you&apos;re supposed to know what you want to do. It’s an idea that I like to call “the stairs.” Here&apos;s how the stairs go. You show up in college, and you&apos;re supposed to know what you want to major in. That major is supposed to lead you to your first job, and then you get another job, and you get promoted and promoted and promoted forever. The best part about the stairs is safety and security. It feels like you know what you need to do to get ahead. The worst part of the stairs is that it&apos;s like a weird video game that you can get stuck inside of for years. The stairs will make you feel like your self-worth is tied to your title, or your last performance rating, or your next promotion. But the truth is that the stairs are an illusion. These days, excellent careers are not built by excellent stair climbers. Said differently, one of the most important things you can get good at in your career is taking risks. Or, as I like to call it, jumping off cliffs. Let me explain what I mean with a story. When I was 25, I got offered a crazy job. I had spent a couple of years climbing the stairs in Human Resources at Facebook when the leader of another department came to me and asked me to help him start a new project, doing something that I knew nothing about. It was a long-term project, it was risky, and a lot of people told me it would probably fail. I was intrigued, but I was also scared. So I talked to a bunch of different people, and I have to admit, a lot of them told me not to take it. But there was this little voice inside me that just kept saying, &quot;I wonder. I wonder if I can be capable in this completely new environment.&quot; So I took a risk and I took the job. Now I&apos;d like to say that what happened next was that it was obviously a great decision and I was immediately successful. But actually, the first nine months on this project felt a lot more like falling off of a very steep cliff. I had gone from feeling competent and capable in HR to feeling like an absolute idiot all the time. I was sitting in rooms with brilliant people asking very dumb questions. Six months into this job, I got the lowest performance rating of my entire life. I had so many moments when all I wanted to do was run back to the safety and security of the stairs. But about nine months in, something interesting happened. I had to lead a meeting. It sounds simple, but it was a big meeting. It was a complicated debate about a nuanced part of this project. I was successful, and I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting feeling like myself again. I had gone from feeling like a beginner in this new environment to feeling confident and capable. I spent another three years on this project, learning and growing, and on the other side of it, I was a completely different person. I was offered jobs that no one would have offered me if I had stayed in HR. That&apos;s the thing about jumping off cliffs. It doesn&apos;t just take you a couple flights up on the stairs. It&apos;s like a weird elevator that takes you to a whole new place. Cliff jumps teach you who you are and what you are capable of in ways that the stairs can never. To get good at jumping off cliffs, you have to get good at three things. The first is actually jumping off the cliff. (Laughter) After many years of coaching people through career decisions, I know that sometimes it is just not the right time to take a risk, but I can also tell you that most people do not stay stuck on the stairs out of necessity. They stay there out of fear. The trick is to learn to tell the difference between the kind of fear that says, &quot;I&apos;m scared I might run out of money,&quot; which you should actually listen to, and the kind of fear that says, &quot;I&apos;m scared I might fail,&quot; which you should take as a giant green flashing light to jump. Cliff jumps teach you what you are capable of in spite of fear. The second thing you have to get good at in order to get good at jumping off cliffs is surviving the fall. Jumping off a cliff is taking a giant step backwards into the land of being a beginner again. That means it&apos;s a very big learning process. And with that comes a huge emotional roller coaster. Daily. Weekly. Sometimes hourly. All of my jumps have involved vacillating wildly between feeling like, &quot;Oh, maybe I&apos;m going to be good at this,&quot; and then immediately feeling like, &quot;Who the hell even gave me this job in the first place?&quot; All of that is normal, and it doesn&apos;t actually mean that anything is wrong. You have to learn to expect the roller coaster and ignore it at the same time. The most valuable mantra for me in this phase has been: give it two weeks. A lot of people will tell you to sleep on it. I can tell you most of these emotions don&apos;t go away overnight. Two weeks is a great barometer for things that you should actually pay attention to. The third thing you have to get good at in order to get good at jumping off cliffs is becoming a professional idiot. (Laughter) I can tell you that this is one of my greatest strengths. I am comfortable sounding like a moron. I am great at sitting in rooms with brilliant people asking very dumb questions. But what that actually means is that I have become an extraordinary learner. My favorite phrase is, &quot;Sorry if this is a stupid question, but.&quot; When you ask it that way, everybody wants to make you feel better. They&apos;re like, &quot;No, no, that&apos;s not a dumb question.&quot; And then they would love to teach you what they know. People love being teachers. It makes them feel smart. The other thing you discover is that most stupid questions aren&apos;t actually stupid. So many people are afraid of sounding dumb that the world is littered with important questions that never got asked. Questions like, &quot;Can you define that word for me?&quot;, &quot;Why are we doing this?&quot;, &quot;Why are we having this meeting?&quot; (Laughter) Embracing being a professional idiot often actually makes you the most valuable person in the room. There&apos;s a last thing, part of the illusion of the stairs, that becomes really obvious the more cliffs that you jump off of. And that is the idea that there is one set of stairs, one definition of success. I have a lot of friends that have climbed up the stairs to some version of the top -- a fancy title, a lot of money, fame -- and then they&apos;ve realized that they&apos;re miserable. One friend described becoming CEO of her company and immediately thinking, &quot;Is this all there is?&quot; You know what she did next? She jumped off a professional cliff. She went from being the CEO of a marketing agency to helping people who were dying in hospice. Success is not the same for everyone. I know that what I&apos;m talking about isn&apos;t easy. It takes bravery to trade the known for the unknown. It takes courage to do something that might seem like a step sideways or backwards to someone else. But you will never really know who you are or what you are capable of until you learn how to try. Thank you. (Applause)"
554577,lawrence_bernstein_the_trick_to_powerful_public_speaking,Lawrence Bernstein,The trick to powerful public speaking,https://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_bernstein_the_trick_to_powerful_public_speaking,"Good afternoon everybody. Everybody here has been incredibly kind and welcoming. I parked the car, I came out of the car park, and somebody immediately came up to me, asked me what I was up to. Said she&apos;d look after everything, and then she said, &quot;I hope it goes well.&quot; And I thought, &quot;I haven&apos;t really focused on going well,&quot; what it actually means here today. And I guess if you&apos;re not feeling terribly positive, it means not forgetting what you&apos;re going to say, which would be quite helpful. It means nobody laughing at you, unless you&apos;re trying to tell a joke. And it means not looking over and seeing people falling asleep, looking at their phones or generally ignoring you. And those are, by the way, three of the biggest fears of people, subconsciously, when they&apos;re about to speak in public. So I&apos;m going to set my sights just a tiny bit higher than that and say that I would love it as the only thing you take away from this talk that next time you have to give a speech or a presentation or you&apos;re talking in a seminar or whatever it might be, that you just remember those two cups of coffee. And for the non-coffee drinkers amongst you, peppermint tea, even a beer is absolutely fine. Because the sad truth is that however hard we work at what we&apos;re going to say, however much we learn the facts and the figures and all these things that a typical member of this audience tomorrow, this time tomorrow, I will be amazed if you remember more than one thing I&apos;ve said. Or more than one thing that any of the other amazing speakers with their brilliant stories have said, because we just live in such a phenomenally noisy, busy world. We&apos;ve got WhatsApps and streams and apps and things to watch and things to do and things to learn, and we&apos;ve got dates to go on and games to go to. By this time tomorrow, these talks will be a distant, distant memory. And it&apos;s extraordinary how our brains are relatively selective about what we remember. Now this doesn’t help, and I include myself in amongst this, this doesn&apos;t help the nervous public speaker. Now that fear is a real problem, because it means that we approach our speeches already worried about how we&apos;re going to look and sound. And it&apos;s why often we do things that are a bit unlike us. Some people just start talking really quickly,  and they get through their content and they can&apos;t stop. And other people freeze and they just stand absolutely still and all the energy drains from them and they start to talk in a monotone. Isn&apos;t so great for being heard. This is the fight or flight response. And it means that when we are under pressure and we feel that spotlight on us, we just start to behave in very unnatural ways. Now this is where I come back to the cup of coffee. Because if after this, I bump into one or two of you at the canteen, we have a chat and you ask me what I&apos;m doing for the rest of the weekend, I hope, if you had a football shirt on, I might say I’m looking forward to watching a game on telly, and I might give you the absolute highlight of what I&apos;m up to. See if it connects, see how you react. I might say, &quot;I&apos;m knackered after all that prep for TED. I&apos;m going to spend the rest of the weekend watching boxsets on TV.&quot; What I probably wouldn&apos;t say is, &quot;Thank you so much for asking that question. I&apos;m going to break the weekend down into 12 points, and I&apos;m going to talk through each point one by one and break the weekend into segments. But before I do that, I&apos;d like to introduce the concept of the weekend, and I&apos;d like to talk about the weekend as a post-industrial concept, because it didn&apos;t really exist before the Industrial Revolution.&quot; If I talk like that, would you think I was slightly, slightly unusual? And we sort of laugh about this stuff, and I laugh about it a lot. But actually, when we are under pressure, particularly in a professional situation or a student having to give a seminar that really matters, we start to talk in that way. Let me tell you about two jobs I&apos;ve done relatively recently, and I will keep the names and the places anonymous to protect the innocent. So a few months ago, I went to another university campus where the human resources team had asked if I would help six of them develop their communication skills. And it was one of those days. Sometimes people in these groups don&apos;t really want to go on a course, they&apos;re very busy, you can get quite a frosty reception because people don&apos;t want any sense of criticism. But on this day I turned up and the sun was shining and I arrived and the head of human resources came up to me, phenomenally friendly, she did everything but hug me. She offered me a drink, she took me inside. She told me a story about one of her kids had dropped ink all over her school uniform before she&apos;d left that morning. She made me feel completely at ease, and I knew instantly it was going to be a great day. And she introduced me to her colleagues, and we all had a chat about worries and what we had to do when we spoke in public. And then I said, &quot;Right guys, it&apos;s time to do it. Let&apos;s each of you, you&apos;ve got a minute or two to prepare, but could you for one minute talk to me about something important that&apos;s going on at work at the moment? And the other five will be your audience. And I will also pull out a camera, and the camera is going to film you just to put you under that little bit of pressure.&quot; We&apos;ll call her Jane, the head of HR. I said, &quot;Jane, would you like to go first?&quot; She said, &quot;No, not really.&quot; So I said, &quot;Go on, you&apos;re the leader here, Jane.&quot; And this is what happened to this charismatic woman. She said, &quot;Well, there are a number of reasons we&apos;re here today, and I&apos;d really ... the important thing is the LRUs. And I&apos;m going to talk about the needs of LRUs and what they need ...&quot; And she went on like this for a minute, and at the end everyone gave her a little polite round of applause. And I turned to her colleagues and said, &quot;Guys, what is an LRU?&quot; And ... I got some blank faces and said, &quot;Jane, what is an LRU?&quot; And she went, &quot;Oh, it&apos;s a learning receptor unit.&quot; Now anyone know what a learning receptor unit is? Guys, you are all learning receptor units right now. A learning receptor unit is somebody on a course or a delegate at a talk in the small print in the HR department of this place. And what had happened is Jane had turned from this incredibly charismatic speaker having coffee with me beforehand, but she had failed the coffee shop test. When she was under pressure, she started speaking like some sort of corporate robot. Now I get paid to do some very odd things. And a little before that, I was asked by one of the big transport providers in the country if I&apos;d go and sit in their boardroom where 30 very stern-looking, middle-aged people with laptops and notepads receive presentations of five minutes each from a bunch of very senior engineers. And each engineer is coming in to ask for money for a new project. And this group has to decide. It&apos;s like the gladiators in the amphitheater. That means they get the money and they go on, and that means you have to go and find something else to do. The first guy, call him Jim, wasn&apos;t his name. Jim walks in and he flusters around and he puts up a slide which has got notes and graphs and numbers and charts and God knows what else. And again, I&apos;ll paraphrase, but he stood there and just went, &quot;Well, I&apos;m going to talk about the footbridge. We&apos;ve got to get through a number of -- there&apos;s a number of reasons we need it. I&apos;m going to talk about the background. I&apos;m going to give you an introduction to the subject.&quot; And he went on and on. And with about 4.5 minutes gone, he then said, &quot;And what really matters is the type of material we use to build the bridge.&quot; And to be honest, it was beyond me at this point, but it was something steel or aluminium or iron or some choice. And then he finished. And there was an intense debate for about two minutes amongst two of the team, the board of this organization, about which type of metal would be better. And at the end of the session they had a vote. Poor old Jim, he&apos;d asked for a million pounds to keep his team busy building this footbridge. And after the session had finished, I went down to their canteen. I spend a lot of time in coffee shops. And I saw him sitting alone, looking a bit miserable. And I said, mate, do you mind if I just have a quick chat about how it went? So why did you need the footbridge built? And he said, &quot;Because there&apos;s a junction on a bend near this very, very busy transport system, and it sits between the housing estate and the local school. And every morning our CCTV catches kids sprinting across the junction trying to get to school because they haven&apos;t got time to go up the road another half mile to go over the footbridge that&apos;s already there. And we reckon in the last couple of months three kids have almost died. They&apos;ve been inches away from dying. And this footbridge would have saved their lives.&quot; And I said, &quot;Why didn&apos;t you tell them that?&quot; He said, &quot;No, but you have to be more professional than that. You have to go through all the detail.&quot; And this board clearly didn&apos;t have a clue that this was the reason. And they turned down something on the basis of the material he would have used for a footbridge, and they weren&apos;t even engineers, rather than the need to save children&apos;s lives. Again, he&apos;d failed the coffee shop test. And ultimately, the more pressure we are under and the higher the stakes are, be they your friend&apos;s 21st birthday party, be they a job interview where you&apos;re speaking to a panel, be they a TED Talk, where you&apos;ve been planning to get your great idea over to the world for years and years and years, you&apos;ve got to appeal to people&apos;s human side. And what we do in a coffee shop completely naturally is we think about our audience, and we are relevant to them and to their needs. We think entirely about using -- we don&apos;t even think about using our natural charisma because it happens. We just appeal to their better nature. We tell them things they think they will enjoy. And that starts with stories. Even the most complicated subjects come to life when we tell a story. And I&apos;m sure recently, all of you are aware of the Post Office scandal that&apos;s gone on in the UK. Everyone know what I&apos;m talking about, and the Horizon software that has ruined the lives of people who were working honestly in post offices, these subpostmasters. You&apos;d think this was news, but actually this has been going on for 20 years. And you know, I like to try and keep up with current affairs, but I couldn&apos;t miss, this thing has been in &quot;Private Eye,&quot; it&apos;s been in Sunday newspapers, it&apos;s gone through the high courts. It&apos;s been inside the papers, but always on a very technical, mathematical, legal basis. All that&apos;s happened in the last two months is there was a TV show about it. But the TV show didn’t focus on the facts and the figures at the beginning anyway. It focused on people, an emotional connection to those people. And we saw how these lives, through storytelling, had been completely and utterly transformed. And within weeks, the Prime Minister is promising hundreds of millions of pounds of compensation without even having a vote in Parliament. That is the power of storytelling. Now I’m not saying the detail doesn’t matter, and some of you, I&apos;m sure, are doing the most phenomenally complex academic subjects that you&apos;re going to need to talk about as you graduate and go into careers. But still, the way you would describe that subject to a friend over a coffee is a brilliant way to introduce it to an audience who may need you to give them a lot of information, but still need to be hooked in, in this busy world where they are so easily distracted. And the coffee shop thing continues again and again and again, it&apos;s a benchmark for everything. When we talk to our friends, we look at the benefits of a problem rather than its features. So I went to the GP some time ago. I&apos;d had a tummy ache that had been going on for days, and I just began to get a bit worried about it. And the GP does what GP&apos;s do and prodded around and asked me questions. It was all a bit mucky. And then typed some stuff into his computer and then looked at me and said, &quot;Mr. Bernstein, I think you&apos;ve got a problem with electrolytes and pathogenic bacteria.&quot; And I can promise you, my sort of mild state of worry turned into complete panic. I can remember the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I thought, &quot;Oh my God, this is it, I&apos;m finished.&quot; I said, &quot;What does that mean?&quot; And he said, “Well, I think it’s food-related.” And I said, &quot;Well, I&apos;m not going to die of food poisoning?&quot; &quot;No, no, no, I think you&apos;ll be fine by the weekend.&quot; Now, what he had done is used his technical knowledge to give me the facts before he&apos;d actually explained the context and the benefit to me. And had he gone about it the other way and said, &quot;Mr. Bernstein, you&apos;re going to be absolutely fine. I think it’s food-related.” I would have said, &quot;What is it?&quot; He would have told me all about his electrolytes, and I would have been fascinated. But in a coffee shop, the first thing you ask your friend is how they are. And they will either say they&apos;re great or not so great. They won&apos;t go into the technical medical detail, and if they are, you probably wouldn&apos;t be having a coffee with them in the first place. The other thing we do when we go into a coffee shop is we talk about our key message. We talk about the subject. We don&apos;t leave it until 10 minutes before we&apos;re due to leave. We let them know that we&apos;re going to talk about the match, or we ask them if they saw the TV show, or we ask how their date went last night before we get into the minutia of what they might have worn or what they had for their starter. Again, we get to the key message and in my case, the key message is simply that we waste too much time worrying about the symptoms of public speaking worry, which are things like shaking and looking like this and breathing too quickly. And we try and cure those when in fact they&apos;re not the problem. It&apos;s a bit like going to the doctor when you&apos;ve got hay fever and lots of sneezing and saying, &quot;Can you help me?&quot; And he says, &quot;Get a softer tissue.&quot; It doesn&apos;t really stop you sneezing. What you want is the antihistamine. And for public speaking, the antihistamine is your content. And if you talk to a group of people the same way you would talk to a friend, you will find your natural charisma and energy comes to life. You&apos;ll start to move your hands without thinking about it, because that&apos;s what you do when you&apos;re on the telephone to a friend, and you will find that instantly, thinking about those cups of coffee will relax you and make you more confident next time you have to go and speak in public. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

But have you considered what you eat is more than tastes, trends and nutrition? What we think is good to eat reveals our modern hungers, our deepest desires and greatest needs for self-improvement, for connection. Also dreams of our future. Kids are our future, right? So try a square pizza, with some chocolate milk and maybe a fruit cup, to taste the future. A school lunch reveals our values, as well as the modern complexities of food. How we&apos;re eating is eating up our worlds. I&apos;m June Jo Lee, a food ethnographer. Tell me what&apos;s good to eat so I can see who you&apos;re becoming. And if I know who you&apos;re becoming, I&apos;ll know what you&apos;ll be eating. Food is my portal to understand generational changes and to track early signals. Join me to decode Gen Z, born 1997 to 2012. How they talk about food is unlike any generation I&apos;ve studied before. My approach is simple. I ask, “What’s delicious to you? What feeds your life?” Like any relationship, it begins with attraction. It&apos;s founded on respect, and it’s 95 percent listening with great care and can be done over a shared meal or snack. Why do I care so much about this work? Because I almost lost my own Gen Zer, my son Blue. He&apos;d stopped talking to me by middle school, and in 2018, I got the call. &quot;Mom, I&apos;m not doing so well. I need help.&quot; And the only thing I had to save my son was my work, my ethnography. You see, I used to be a tiger mom. I thought being a mom meant to tell my son who to become, what to do. I never asked him who he was, what he wanted. He told me: “You exhaust me. You think I’m in your head” And he asked me ... &quot;Why don&apos;t you just treat me like your ethnography, not your son. Ethnog me, Mom.&quot; (Laughter) And -- (Sighs) In that moment, my heart broke. But I did it, I ethnogged my own son. I asked him ... &quot;What&apos;s your unforgettable bite? Your tricky mouthful? How does it feel to be in the world?&quot; And he told me, &quot;I feel like I&apos;m just learning to surf, on the edge of crashing into the waves and plunging into the water and not being able to breathe or know if I&apos;m up or down. But maybe someday, I&apos;ll get good at surfing.&quot; Gen Z, like Blue, are open, fluid, queer by default. They are globally connected, hyper-self-aware, and data-based. They are feeling everything. Digital devices are nourishing. Digital is also disorienting. Gen Z are our power users of the future, learning to ride the waves of a chaotic era. Gen Z like Luis entered adulthood tagged by a global pandemic, learning in solitary confinement and living on a terminal timeline. I asked Luis, “How does the world taste?” And he said, &quot;Spicy. Climate tastes a lot spicier than it used to. It&apos;s demotivating when people are telling you, ’Dude, all the carbon’s already in the atmosphere at irreversible levels. You know money-hungry people aren’t going to stop being money-hungry.’” Luis is the first Sarabia to attend Stanford University, and for Luis, life is as simple and as complex as tacos. He told me, &quot;I&apos;m so proud my culture created something so delicious.&quot; For Luis, tacos are family, tacos are friends, tacos are hope. Gen Z are carrying hot sauce in their backpack to make bland, no-change food palatable. They&apos;re our hot sauce to tell us they&apos;re just at the starting line. It’s not the finish line for them. And they’re more than hot sauce. Olivia is a future food systems entrepreneur. I asked her, &quot;How are you learning to care more about food?&quot; And she told me, &quot;Well, I&apos;m zero-wastifying for my Fancy Scraps pop-ups. And this weekend, I&apos;m volunteering at a cabbage three-way workshop. I can learn how to make kimchi, pao cai and sauerkraut.&quot; Gen Z, like Olivia, are learning to care more about what they eat and don&apos;t eat. Waste hurts. Waste is a resource out of place. And Gen Z are resources determined to find their place in well-functioning cultures, and it&apos;s not easy. It hurts not to be creative. Gen Z are kimchi-ing their way through our hot messes, fermenting and upcycling more delicious and nutritious worlds. So Blue is my love story of more care reconnecting and curing our separation. Earlier this year, I ethnogged Blue again. (Video) June Jo Lee: What&apos;s the flavor of trust? Blue: Savory. Savory seems more reliable. JJL: What is the flavor of change? B: Sour. Because when things decay, they turn sour. I&apos;m just trying to make the most out of the present moment. You can&apos;t really predict how things are going to change. Instead of planning out, like, a very specific life trajectory, just kind of go with what happens. JJL: I love you, Blue. B: I love you too, Mom. JJL: Can you ask me a question? Ask me anything. B: What’s your salad-dressing recipe? (Audience laughter) JJL: Let’s root for our kids, all our kids, to make it to shore. Gen Z are our hot sauce, our kimchi, our mentors of new ways. They have challenged me, inspired me and helped me become a better human and a better mom. You can be a food ethnographer too. It&apos;s not that hard. Here&apos;s how. Start by asking, “What’s your flavor of home? What makes you go ‘mm’? What makes you go ‘hmm’? How are you learning to care more about food in your life?” We all eat, so we all have the power to shape our future. What do you feel is good to eat, and how can we make more of that? Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

But all this changed in the 1790s, when British metalworker Henry Maudslay developed this highly precise lathe. Suddenly, these previously handmade components could be reproduced mechanically, and at scale. This may seem like a simple innovation, but it had a profound effect on the world. The standardization of these parts helped usher in the Industrial Revolution. From cars to home appliances, the 20th century was defined by mass production and readily available interchangeable parts. This made repairing items relatively easy. If your shower head gasket failed  or the hose for your washing machine sprang a leak, a hardware store likely carried replacements. Today, interchangeable parts are as important as ever for mass production. However, some companies are working hard to prevent consumers from swapping out components on their own. In many cases, repair can only be done by the original manufacturer, if at all. With limited repair options available, we end up buying new and throwing more items out. This is especially true for electronics. In 2022, we discarded about 62 million tons of e-waste, along with billions of dollars’ worth of precious metals inside of them. So how exactly do companies prevent repair? Some make it physically more difficult to fix items. They can glue parts in place rather than using screws. Others limit the information they share with consumers, like blocking public access to product information and schematics. During the pandemic, for instance, when hospitals struggled to maintain breaking medical equipment, the repair company iFixit compiled a comprehensive database of repair manuals for hospitals to use. Yet manufacturers like Steris fought for them to be taken down. Yet perhaps the most important, yet least obvious, way companies limit repair is by preventing the interchangeability of parts. In a process known as parts pairings, companies assign individual parts like screens, batteries, or sensors a unique serial number. The device&apos;s internal software can then detect if those components are replaced and limit their functionality as a result. If you swap the screen on two brand new iPhones, for example, the automatic brightness adjustment will no longer work. In other cases, unauthorized replacements  can cause the device to stop functioning altogether. If a farmer uses an independent shop to repair certain parts in a John Deere tractor, it won’t operate until a company technician authenticates the new part using authorized software. With only a limited number of company technicians available, this can easily create a bottleneck, costing farmers precious time and money, and even jeopardizing crops. Manufacturers can also use software to give devices  predetermined end-of-life dates, after which, they no longer receive important updates, and slowly become unusable. All this gives manufacturers unprecedented control over the products we buy and limits the way we repair them. Critics liken these tactics to a form of planned obsolescence, a manufacturing strategy where a product is deliberately designed to fail, to keep both demand and profits high. But companies pose two main arguments in defense of these practices. First, they claim that giving consumers and third-party repair shops access to their software could create cybersecurity risks. They also argue that they could be liable if a product malfunctions after a third party or consumer repair. A shoddy repair to a medical device, for instance, could have deadly consequences, and the manufacturer could be blamed. However, major reports, like those from the US Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration find little support for these company claims. Parts pairing and repair limiting practices are now being closely scrutinized in courts all over the world, as consumers fight for the right to repair. And states, including Colorado and Oregon, have passed laws banning parts pairing. Community-led movements have also taken root. Over 2,500 cities across the globe, from Amsterdam to Boise to Bangalore, have established repair cafes. Here, people trade and share their knowledge, reinvigorating a culture of repair at a time when it often feels easier to toss our things than fix them."
554575,max_jaderberg_how_ai_is_saving_billions_of_years_of_human_research_time,Max Jaderberg,How AI is saving billions of years of human research time,https://www.ted.com/talks/max_jaderberg_how_ai_is_saving_billions_of_years_of_human_research_time,"So a while ago now, I did a PhD, and I actually thought it would be quite easy to do research. Turns out it was really hard. My PhD was spent coding up neural network layers and writing CUDA kernels, very much computer-based science. And at that time, I had a friend who worked in a lab doing real messy science. He was trying to work out the structure of proteins experimentally. And this is a really difficult thing to do. It can take a whole PhD&apos;s worth of work just to work out the structure of a single new protein system. And then 10 years later, the field that I was in, machine learning, revolutionized his world of protein structure. A neural network called AlphaFold was created by DeepMind that can very accurately predict the structure of proteins and solved this 50-year challenge of trying to do protein folding.  And just two weeks ago, this won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. And it&apos;s estimated that since the release of this model, we&apos;ve saved over a billion years of research time. (Applause) A billion years. (Applause) A whole PhD&apos;s worth of work is now approximated by a couple of seconds of neural network time. And to my friend, this might sound a bit depressing, and I&apos;m sorry about that, but to me, this is just really an incredible thing. The sheer scale of new knowledge about our protein universe that we now have access to, due to an AI model that&apos;s able to replace the need for real-world experimental lab work. And that frees up our precious human time to begin probing the next frontiers of science. Now some people say that this is a one-time-only event, that we can&apos;t expect to see these sort of breakthroughs in science with AI to be repeated. And I disagree. We will continue to see breakthroughs in understanding our real messy world with AI. Why? Because we now have the neural network architectures that can eat up any data modality that you throw at them. And we have tried and tested recipes of incorporating any possible signal in the world into these learning algorithms. And then we have the engineering and infrastructure to scale these models to whatever size is needed to take advantage of the massive amounts of compute power that we can create. And finally, we&apos;re always creating new ways to record and measure every detail of our real messy world that then creates even bigger data sets that help us train even richer models. And so this is a new paradigm in front of us, that of creating AI analogs of our real messy world. This new AI paradigm takes our real, messy, natural world and learns to recreate the elements of it with neural networks. And why these AI analogs are so powerful is that it&apos;s not just about understanding, approximating or simulating the world for the sake of understanding, but this actually gives us a little virtual world that we can experiment in at scale to ultimately create new knowledge. And you can imagine that this experimentation against our AI analogs, this can also happen in silico, in a computer with other agents, in a loop of in silico, open-ended discovery, ultimately to create new knowledge that we can take back out and change the world around us. And this isn&apos;t science fiction. Right now, we have thousands of graphics cards burning, training foundational models of our own micro-biological world, and then agents that are probing these AI analogs to design new molecules that could be potential new drugs. And I want to show you exactly how this process works for us, because I believe it can serve as a blueprint to bring about a whole new wave of the future of AI-driven scientific and technological progress. Now drug design is such an important area to focus on because it&apos;s actually becoming harder and harder to design new drugs. This is a graph of the number of new drugs created per billion dollars of R and D spent over time. And what you can see is that the number of new drugs is exponentially decreasing. It&apos;s becoming more and more expensive to create a new drug. Now during this same time period, we&apos;ve had a huge amount of advancement in the capabilities of AI, driven by a whole host of algorithmic breakthroughs. But one of the secret sources of this advancement in AI has also been that of Moore&apos;s Law, that the amount of computing power has just been exponentially increasing over time. And these days, it perhaps isn&apos;t Moore&apos;s Law that we should care about, but Jensen&apos;s law. Jensen Huang, being the CEO of Nvidia, for the exponential increase in GPU FLOPS that are now powering our neural networks. So really the question is, how do we bring this world of AI and machine learning to that of drug design? Can we think about using our AI analogs to reverse this curse of Eroom’s law and jump on this exponential wave of GPU FLOPS powering our neural networks? Actually bringing these worlds together and driving this change is the day-to-day responsibility that I feel. So how can we go about modeling biology? Well if we were in the world of physics, for example, modeling the universe, then we can actually write down a lot of the theory by hand with maths and very accurately predict, for example, the unfolding of the universe, even millions of light years away. But we can&apos;t do that for the incredibly complex dynamics within ourselves. We can&apos;t just write down some equations for ourselves. We can perhaps write down the theory of how atoms interact. That&apos;s physics. But then simulating these interactions on the scale of trillions of atoms within our cells is just completely unfeasible. And then we haven&apos;t worked out how to describe these complex dynamics in coarser and simpler terms that we could write down with maths. It’s just crazy to think that we can model the universe so far away but not the cells at our fingertips. But AI and machine learning can be the perfect abstraction for a biological world. Using the snippets of data that we can record from our cells, we can then learn the equations and theories and abstractions implicitly within the activations of our neural networks. In fact, our company is called Isomorphic Labs. Isomorphic because we believe there is an isomorphism, a fundamental symmetry, that we can create between the biological world and the world of information science, machine learning and AI. So to see how we are using these AI analogs today, I want to dive into the body and have a look into cells and think about proteins. Now proteins are one of the fundamental building blocks of life. And these proteins carry different functions in the body. And if we can modulate the function of a protein, then we are well on our way to creating a new drug. Proteins are made up of a sequence of amino acids, and there are about 20 different amino acids, each one here depicted by a different letter. An amino acid is a collection of atoms, a molecule, and these molecules are joined together into a linear sequence. And the function of a protein is not just due to the sequence of these proteins, but also due to the three-dimensional shape that these proteins fold up into. And there are thousands of proteins inside of us, each with their own unique sequences and their own unique 3D shape. And remember, trying to work out experimentally that 3D shape can take months or even years of lab work. But with the breakthrough of AlphaFold and AlphaFold 2 in 2020, we now have a model that can take the sequence of amino acids as input and then very accurately predict the 3D structure of a protein as the output. And this allows us to actually fill in the gaps of our known protein universe. It&apos;s our AI analog of proteins. So proteins carry their function. But these proteins, they don&apos;t actually act in isolation. They&apos;re part of bigger molecular machines with these proteins interacting with other proteins as well as other biomolecules like DNA, RNA and small molecules. For example, let&apos;s zoom in and have a look at this protein. This is a protein that repairs DNA, and it interacts with DNA clamping down on it, helping facilitate repair and then the repaired DNA is released back out to the cell. Now in drug design what we want to do is either make molecular machines work better or actually stop them from working. And in this case, for cancer, we actually want to stop this particular DNA repair protein from working, because in cancerous cells there is no backup DNA repair mechanism. And so if we stop this one working, then cancerous cells will die, leaving just healthy cells remaining. So what would a drug actually look like for this protein? Well a drug is something that comes in and modulates a molecular machine. And this could be a drug molecule that goes into the body, goes into the cell and then sticks to this protein just over here. And this drug molecule actually glues the DNA repair proteins clamp shut, so it can&apos;t do effective DNA repair causing cancerous cells to die and leaving just healthy cells remaining. Now to design such an amazing drug molecule completely rationally, we&apos;d have to understand how all of these biomolecular elements come together. We would need an AI analog of all and any biomolecular systems. Earlier this year, we had a breakthrough. We developed a new version of AlphaFold, called AlphaFold 3, that can model the structure of almost all biomolecules coming together with unprecedented accuracy. This model takes as input the protein sequence, the DNA sequence and the molecule atoms. And these inputs are fed to a neural network that has a large processing trunk based on transformers. Now unlike a large language model that operates on one- dimensional sequences, instead, our model uses what’s called a “pairformer” and operates on a 2D interaction grid of the input sequence. And this allows our model to explicitly reason about every pairwise interaction that could occur in this biomolecular system. And so we can use the features of this processing trunk to condition a diffusion model. Now you might know diffusion models as these amazing image generative models. Now just like diffusing the pixels in an image, instead, our diffusion model diffuses the 3D atom coordinates of our biomolecular system. So now this gives us a completely malleable virtual biomolecular world. It’s our AI analog that we can probe as if it’s the real world. We can make changes to the inputs, changes to the molecule designs and see how that changes the output structure. So let&apos;s use this model to design a new drug for our DNA repair protein. We can take a small molecule that&apos;s been recorded to stick to this protein and make changes to its design. We want to change the molecule design so that this molecule makes more interactions with the protein, and that will make it stick to this protein stronger. And so you can imagine that this gives a human drug designer a perfect game to play. How do I change the design of this molecule to create more interactions? Now normally, a drug designer would have to wait months to get results back from a real lab at each step of this design game. But for us, using this AI analog, this takes just seconds. And this is the reality of what our drug designers back in London are doing right now. So we have this beautiful game that&apos;s being played by our drug designers, who are using this AI analog of biomolecular systems to rationally design potential new drug molecules. But you can imagine that we don&apos;t have to just limit this game to human drug designers Earlier in my career, I worked on training agents to beat the top human professionals at the game of StarCraft. And we created game-playing agents for the games of Go and Capture the Flag. So why can&apos;t we create agents that instead play the game that our human drug designers are playing? So now our AI analog becomes the game environment, and we can train agents against that. And we already have some incredibly powerful agents that are already doing this today. Now in this setup, all of the drug design is happening on a computer. So what happens if we have access to many, many computers? Well instead of having one human drug designer working on some new molecule designs, instead, we can have thousands of agents doing molecule design in parallel. Just imagine what impact that could have on patients suffering from a rare type of cancer, the speed that we could get to a potential new molecule to address this medical need or the ability to go after many diseases in parallel. Cancer is often caused by mutations of proteins, and even within the same type of cancer, each patient can have different mutations. And that means that one drug molecule won&apos;t work for all patients. But what if we could go in and measure each individual patient&apos;s protein mutations, and then have a whole team of molecule-design agents working on that individual&apos;s protein mutations? Then we could create a molecule tailored for each individual patient. I&apos;m showing just this. Here the protein is randomly mutating, and each mutation in red subtly changes the 3D shape of this protein. And we&apos;re able to generate molecules that should stick to this protein in response to these changes. Now this is still far away from patients, and there&apos;s a huge amount of complexity in drug design left to tackle, but this really does give us a glimpse at the future that is to come. So we&apos;ve seen how this new AI paradigm is driving our progression in drug design. And you can also see this paradigm being played out in material science, in creating new forms of energy and in chemistry. The ability to take our real messy world and then create our own AI analogs to then on a computer do open-ended scientific discovery to create new knowledge that we can take back out and change the world around us. This is an incredibly powerful paradigm, and one that will bring about a whole new wave of scientific and technological advancements. And we’re going to need as many people as possible, especially those working in machine learning, AI and technology, to help drive this new wave of progression. Thank you. (Applause)"
553436,scott_shigeoka_can_curiosity_heal_division,Scott Shigeoka,Can curiosity heal division?,https://www.ted.com/talks/scott_shigeoka_can_curiosity_heal_division,"So back in 2017, I went on a trip to Joshua Tree, and I started to experience auditory hallucinations. They lasted for days, and then weeks and then months, and they said really nasty things. They said, &quot;You&apos;re a freak. You&apos;re unlovable. You don&apos;t belong here.&quot; And so, like most people, I tried to push them away. I tried to ignore them, pretend like they didn&apos;t exist. But they kept coming back, louder and stronger. And so I was a really good millennial, and I went to my therapist, who said, &quot;Have you ever tried getting curious about those voices and really hearing what they&apos;re saying?&quot; And that was a clutch-your-pearls kind of moment for me, because I was like, &quot;You want me to get curious about what I fear?&quot; But he had never led me astray. He always helped me to grow. Shout out to my therapist. And so I took his advice. And the next time that the voices came back, I really listened. And over time, I started to notice that those voices mirrored what I had been told as a kid, or what I even told myself when I was feeling shame, or when I was bullied for being queer or socially awkward. And I realized these voices weren&apos;t dark forces that I needed to repel. I realized that they were pointing me to a younger version of myself that was inside of me, that was yearning for attention, that was yearning for connection and really wanted to heal. And that&apos;s why I learned to love my voices. It also taught me a lot about my work. I work at UC Berkeley&apos;s Greater Good Science Center, and I lead research-based explorations on the division that we&apos;re experiencing here and across the world. It’s how we shame people or dismiss them or judge them, because they voted differently than us in the last elections, or because they hold an identity that seems to clash with our own. And what I&apos;ve learned through my work is that one way we can navigate through this time is if we replace our certainty about what we think we know of other people with a curiosity about what we don&apos;t yet know, or what we might have gotten wrong. And that led me to a road trip. For a whole year, went around the country in my little Toyota Prius, and I traveled to Trump rallies, and I met with religious communities, and I lived in rural towns. And what I was guided by is rather than see people as the “other,” could I actually call them in, and connect with them rather than cancel them? Could there be a way where I could even find commonalities and a shared humanity? Could I actually learn to love them like I learned to love my voices? And what I learned on a personal level is actually what psychological research also says, that the more you come into contact with people who are different from you, the less likely it is that you&apos;ll feel threatened by them. On one stop in my road trip, I went to a convent and I met a group of Catholic sisters that were living with this really motley crew of millennials. They were living there for six months as part of a group called Nuns and Nones. And they explored really interesting topics, like belonging and justice, and spiritual practice, but they also talked about the vows that Catholic sisters take, the vow of chastity, the vow of poverty and the vow of obedience. Sarah Jane Bradley, one of the residents, a millennial, she told me that she once carried a negative connotation of the word &quot;chastity.&quot; She saw it as a tool to exert power over women or to control their bodies. But Sarah is also fiercely curious, and she wanted to uncover what she didn&apos;t yet know. And so she had conversations with the sisters and asked them about it. And slowly, over time, she realized that the vow of chastity was actually something very different. She called it the “deprivatization of love,” that when Catholic sisters take this vow, they&apos;re able to give care and love to many more people beyond just a partner or immediate family. And she even drew comparisons between the vow and queerness, the ways in which we think about love and nontraditional family structures. The most beautiful part of Sarah&apos;s story, I think, is that she was able to move past her understandings, her initial understandings of what she thought of the vow. She was able to have real conversations with these Catholic sisters, and it shows us that this curiosity that we have isn&apos;t just an intellectual tool to understand and learn things about the world. It&apos;s actually a force for connection. It&apos;s a force for real change in the world. On another stop on my road trip, I went to a Trump rally in Minnesota. And I remember getting there, and there was this sea of red of people who were voting very differently than me in the elections. And I went up to them and I started having conversations, and they told me about their children, their upbringing, you know, what they liked to do for fun. We shared stories, we laughed. But something really interesting also happened. Because I was genuinely interested in them, they started to get curious about me. And I told them about my road trip, I told them about my work in curiosity, but I was also wearing a particularly fabulous outfit that day, not unlike the one I&apos;m wearing today. Look at this ascot. I mean, come on. (Laughter) But what I mean to say is that I didn&apos;t erase or hide my differences. I told them stories about being queer. I told them about my grief about the climate crisis. And to my surprise, many of them actually shared that. And what happened is that who I personally saw as a &quot;Trump voter&quot; began to change. It wasn&apos;t just the stereotype that was fueled by the news and social media and what other people told me. I saw them as real people. I saw them as real people just like me. And what I&apos;ve learned is that maybe we didn&apos;t change our perspective on who we were going to vote for in that election, in those conversations, but what we did do was we interrupted our biases of each other. We moved past othering one another. We were able to find commonalities and even a shared humanity. What I&apos;ve learned from the voices that I&apos;ve heard, to the story of my road trip across the country, to the book I wrote about curiosity, I learned something really critical about love. And yes, I’m gonna drop the L-word right now, y’all. I think it&apos;s really important. There&apos;s an old adage that some of us might have heard, that love is a verb. But my question was always, &quot;OK, what&apos;s the verb?&quot; How do we actually practice this? What&apos;s the action? And what I&apos;ve learned through my years of research and experience is that the best way that we can love better is for us to practice curiosity. Because when we practice curiosity, we turn toward someone, we say, &quot;I want to know your story. I want to know who you are. I want to understand your full humanity, your nuances, your complexities, everything that makes you you, and I want to do this not because I want to change your view or your perspectives or who you are. I want to do this because I want to get to know you, because you matter to me, because I care about you, because I love you.&quot; Curiosity is not just this intellectual tool, it&apos;s also this heart-centered force that we can bring into our life, and I think it&apos;s a practice we really need right now in our country and in the world. It also reminds us to look for the good in our lives and not just focus on the bad. It reminds us to look for what’s uniting our communities and our country and not to just focus on what&apos;s fracturing and dividing us. It also tells us to prioritize the questions that we&apos;re asking, as an important step to problem-solving, because we can&apos;t just focus on the answers, whether that’s our schools or in our workplaces or in our communities at large. But the most important thing about curiosity, I think, is how it can help us to love better, whether that&apos;s our children, our parents, our partners, our friends, our colleagues or even someone who holds a very different belief or view or perspective from us. If we can practice curiosity more, I really believe that we can love better. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

(English) This is the way Indigenous Sakha people greet one another. This phrase has no exact English translation, but it means &quot;I greet the universe in your person.&quot; My name is Snow Raven, and I&apos;m from the Republic of Sakha Yakutia in Arctic Siberia, the most cold settled place on Earth, where winter’s temperature can drop as low as negative 96 Fahrenheit. Brrr. So after six years being away from Sakha Yakutia, I returned this summer to see my family and also visit our ancestral home. The first thing I did when I arrived was drop into silence and listen. Listening is one of the powerful gifts the universe has given humans to connect with nature. (Vocalizing wind) (Vocalizing raven calls) It is by listening that I have learned how to mimic nature. I listen with my imagination and become an animal that I hear. I move like it moves. I seek what it seeks. I cry with its cry. (Vocalizing owl calls) The owl, khakhan, for instance. It has night vision. It can see all around him, and it also flies without making a sound. The elie, brown kite, soars on heated air and with joy, announces the arrival of the summer. (Vocalizing elie calls) When I hear the loon, I feel its longing for its partner alongside its love of the baby it carries. (Vocalizing loon calls) The crane, the dance of this beautiful bird is so stunning and divine that Sakha people believe that happy are the eyes who even once witnessed the dance of a crane in a wilderness. (Vocalizing crane calls) The ehe, the brown bear. It&apos;s so mighty and it terrifies everything all around him while even he eats but little berries. (Vocalizing bear grunts) The reindeer, taba, are lords of tundra, and they run thousands of miles in huge herds. To restore and recover their energy, they have a special breath. (Vocalizing reindeer breathing) Bërë. In a wolf’s cry, I can hear the loneliness of the hunter and its yearning for  freedom beyond the body. It sees the moon and wants to join it in the sky. (Vocalizing wolf howling) So the superpower of listening is that it leaves the room for imagination to dance with sound. Let’s listen, ignite our imagination and summon our animal superpowers here and now. (Drumming) (Vocalizing bird calls) (Vocalizing animal calls) (Cheers and applause) (Sahka) Makhtal. Thank you.

554559,bob_mankoff_can_ai_master_the_art_of_humor,Bob Mankoff,Can AI master the art of humor?,https://www.ted.com/talks/bob_mankoff_can_ai_master_the_art_of_humor,"Whether you&apos;re thrilled by what AI can do for us or terrified by what AI is going to do to us, whether it can be funny, is probably not top of mind for you. It is for me. I don&apos;t care if it turns all of us into paperclips, as long as they&apos;re funny paper clips. (Laughter) And the fact that it makes stuff up, hallucinates, for me, that&apos;s not a bug, that&apos;s a feature. My entire career was making stuff up. They&apos;re called cartoons. This is probably the most famous one I hallucinated. There are a number of theories of humor that could explain this cartoon. There&apos;s the superiority theory. You&apos;re the guy on the phone, not on the other end. The incongruity theory. There&apos;s a mismatch between the politeness of the language and the rudeness of the message. And the benign violation theory of humor, which is sort of a golden ratio theory of humor, if you will. See, I got in that term (Laughter) Which says, for something to be funny, it has to have just the right amount of wrong. Now I didn’t use any theories to create that cartoon. And I once said at a talk at Google, there is no algorithm for humor. But now with the rapid pace of AI, I have to wonder, could there be a bot Mankoff? (Laughter) You might think my reflexive answer to this would be, how about never? But while I don&apos;t want to be replaced by a bot, I&apos;m not above being helped by it. Steve Jobs famously said that computers are a bicycle for the mind. If that&apos;s the case, what&apos;s AI, a rocket ship? And at my age, you know what? I&apos;d settle for a walker. (Laughter) The fears of machines replacing humans are not new. This cartoon anticipates by five decades what&apos;s now called the alignment problem, when the goals of machines and humans go horribly awry, at least for one of the parties. Cartoons don&apos;t happen in a cultural vacuum. They&apos;re part of the zeitgeist. Here&apos;s a contemporaneous article about the guy who invented cybernetics, Norbert Wiener, who said thinking machines were putting us on the eve of destruction. Now sadly and tragically, Norbert Wiener died, but not by a thinking machine, but by an unthinking one, he was run over by a bus. (Laughter) That&apos;s not true. I made that up. (Laughter) I hallucinated it because it&apos;s funny. (Laughter) Here&apos;s a great update of that older cartoon. &quot;To think this all began with letting Autocomplete finish our sentence,&quot; which indeed it did. So these fears are not new, not novel. But now, in the immortal words of Nigel Tufnel of &quot;Spinal Tap,&quot; they go to 11. They&apos;re cranked to the max. And here is one of the maximum cranksters of all time, Elon Musk, saying, &quot;AI is one of the biggest threats to humanity.&quot; But certainly not as big as Elon Musk. (Laughter) (Applause and cheers) People like Elon have a p(doom) number. That&apos;s the probability AI is going to wipe us out. I think p(doom) is p(dumb). (Laughter) I&apos;m interested in p(funny), and I’ve been using the New Yorker caption contest to look into the probability of that. Every week since 2005, the New Yorker has presented a cartoon without a caption, and challenged its readers to come up with the winning caption in the caption contest. And for that, they get the glory of being in the New Yorker magazine, a huge amount of money, house in the Bahamas that Sam Bankman-Fried -- Actually, it&apos;s just the glory. On the page of the New Yorker, there&apos;s a contest you enter, the finalists from a few weeks before, three finalists, and a winning caption. So it&apos;s staggered in that way. Each one of these images are funny. They&apos;re incongruous. You&apos;d certainly think they&apos;re humorous, but they&apos;re not funny in a way that you get. They&apos;re not mentally funny. To make it that, of course, you need the right caption. &quot;Any happily married people here tonight?&quot; (Laughter) OK, but with up to 10,000 captions every week, how do you select that? Now from 2005 to early 2016, that burden fell on me and my assistants, but mainly my assistants, to cull, to try to cull the good captions from what we uncharitably call the “craptions.” (Laughter) But then, in early 2016, for the benefit of all humanity, but mainly for me and my assistants, we switched to crowdsourcing. So now for every contest, you vote online, and a funniness score from over a million judgments is given for all the captions. Now overall, I’m against mob rule, but actually in this case, the mob does a pretty good job. Usually, the finalist almost certainly almost all the time, really, the finalists come from the top 200 captions. Well, this is popular, not only with the New Yorker, but it&apos;s caught the eye of data scientists, creativity researchers, cognitive scientists, and AI, of course, and everything adjacent to AI. So that&apos;s why I wasn&apos;t really surprised when -- Oh, it&apos;s up there, thanks. I wasn&apos;t really surprised when Vincent Vanhoucke, then the chief data scientist for Google&apos;s DeepMind, now their head of robotics, sent me this email indicating that winning the caption contest, which was actually somewhat of the sine qua non of human creativity and intelligence. And I was also flattered by that, of course, but I didn&apos;t think they had any chance at all of doing it. And it turned out that was the case. All of the AI juju circa 2016 wasn&apos;t up to the task. It really couldn&apos;t even decode the image. So for the sine qua non of the human mind, DeepMind was non compos mentis and out of its depth. But time and AI marched on, AI marching quadruple time. Vincent gets back to me and says, while human creativity might still be out of reach, we think we have understanding well in hand. He sends me this ridiculous, uber-nerd example of explaining humor. And I said, you know what? Let me give you a cartoon I did in 1997 of this other watershed moment when IBM&apos;s DeepMind defeated Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion. And here&apos;s the cartoon I did then, and it says, &quot;No, I don&apos;t want to play chess. I just want you to reheat the lasagna.&quot; (Laughter) I rate this explanation a solid B-minus. But so what if it was an A? Is there ever going to be a beautiful New Yorker cartoon anthology of explanations? I don&apos;t think so. But the idea that understanding humor could be a stepping stone to creating it sort of made sense. This paper I was involved in tried to look at compared to smart humans, what would the best AIs do on three tasks? Could they, from winning captions from different contests match to the right image? Could they, between two captions, one that won and the one that was pretty good, pick the right one? And could they explain the humor? Now for all of them, you know what? Yeah, humans were still ahead, but AI is closing the gap. The most interesting thing about this paper for me was it showed a pathway for which you could create cartoon humor. And that was how we trained the contest. For 660 -- 653 contests, the AI was trained, fine-tuned, on these examples which humans annotated. A description of the cartoon, explanation of the humor. OK, if you&apos;ve used ChatGPT, you sort of get the idea now. Put a number of examples like this. Put it in the prompt window. Rinse and repeat and you get new cartoons. Well Jack Hessel, the chief author of the paper, did something more sophisticated. And what he did was create 50 synthetic new cartoons generated from this old data in which there were five options for captions. I picked four of them, and I gave them to cartoonist Shannon Wheeler to draw up. Here are the results. Now Shannon said, well, these are weird. They don&apos;t really seem like -- it&apos;s sort of an uncanny valley of cartoons. They&apos;re not quite there. But it is interesting. All of these are new cartoons that never appeared anywhere that are an idea of human -- of computer creativity. And also when you look at it, what it is, it&apos;s weirdness in, weirdness out. The caption contest cartoons are weird. But I do see this now as a tool for brainstorming for cartoonists, in that we played this completely straight. Shannon wasn&apos;t able to manipulate the description of the picture or the caption. Had he done that, it could have been better. Also, we could have asked it to make more. We could have put in the rankings for the humor. We could do all this to improve it. So quality comes out of quantity. You can get an awful lot of quantity here. You can have a human being in the loop to do this. But ... I would not go so far to give AI a true human sense of humor. A human sense of humor is not about making a joke or getting it. It&apos;s rooted in our vulnerability. It&apos;s the blessing we get for the curse of mortality. Mark Twain said the true source of humor is not joy but sorrow. If we gave AI the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to, that would be cruel. If we did that, it might very well want to wipe us out. And if they did, all I ask is that they take Elon first. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause) Now, I think, if I&apos;m not mistaken, we had a caption contest here, right? It&apos;s on the next slide that I had to decide from U of M people. And this was the image we created for the contest. It&apos;s that image. And the one I picked up by Kavya Davuluri was this one. &quot;Above all, I asked the class of 3000 not to forget your humanity.&quot; (Laughter) Now what I will say is, that is really close to a good caption. (Laughter) Mark Twain said the difference between the right word and the wrong word is the difference between the lightning and the lightning bug. That caption should be &quot;Above all, I ask that the class of 3000 to not forget my humanity.&quot; (Laughter) Now you have a joke. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
554361,scarlet_keys_why_do_you_love_your_favorite_songs,Scarlet Keys,Why do you love your favorite songs?,https://www.ted.com/talks/scarlet_keys_why_do_you_love_your_favorite_songs,"Songs are the soundtrack of our lives. From birthday parties, lullabies, our first love, our first heartbreak, our wedding song, our next wedding song, (Laughter) And ultimately the song that’s played at our funeral. Songs enhance the moment or the season. They help us dance. They make us cry. They make us run the extra mile. And they can even make us hate sitting in traffic just a little bit less. Songs help us remember our lives. They are a time capsule and a time machine. Imagine you&apos;re riding in your car next to your partner in your perfectly happy marriage, when all of a sudden that song comes on. That song, you know, that song from that one summer love. And as your partner is sweetly giving you a traffic update, you are gone, evaporated -- (Laughter) evaporated from your heated seat back to that Greek island. (Laughter) With the sunset lips of Pericles Constantine Dinos -- (Laughter) coming in for a kiss. You have been transported by a song that was encoded in your brain that summer. It&apos;s not your fault. Songs are powerful. Have you ever thought about what&apos;s in a song? What&apos;s in those 3.5 minutes of arranged sound that have such impact? We all listen to and turn to songs. I&apos;ve had the privilege of being someone who writes songs, and as a professor at the Berklee College of Music, I help other artists write theirs. And there&apos;s tools we use as songwriters that affect emotion. One of the tools we use is tone. That&apos;s something we all understand, tone. Imagine you&apos;re sitting in a cold hospital room waiting to meet your doctor, wearing nothing but your underwear beneath your &quot;dignity gown.&quot; (Laughter) And your doctor comes in. Nobody wants to hear, “Hello, my name is Dr. Watson, and I’m your brain surgeon.” We want to hear, “Hello, My name is Dr. Watson, and I am your brain surgeon.” Because when his tone of voice goes up, so does your heart rate. And when his tone of voice goes down, you feel calm and like, &quot;I&apos;m in good hands.&quot; So tone of voice matters. The next time you go on a first date, you can either say, &quot;I haven&apos;t been on a date in a while.&quot; (Laughter) Or you can say, &quot;I haven&apos;t been on a date in a while.&quot; (Laughter) It matters, it matters. So think of melody as the song&apos;s tone of voice. How we say what we say is oftentimes more important then what we say. As Western listeners, we have a relationship to melody, and we have an expectation to that relationship. So I’m going to play something. And when I stop playing, I want you to tell me what you expect me to play next. (Playing the scale on piano) Audience: Do. There it is, exactly. (Laughter) So some notes feel stable and some notes feel more unstable, begging for resolution. And that&apos;s very powerful information for a songwriter to know. The words we place on those notes make the listener feel certain things. I&apos;d like to take a moment to ruin an Adele song. (Laughter) I&apos;m sure you&apos;ve all heard her song &quot;Someone Like You.&quot; In the verse and in the pre-chorus she runs into her ex unexpectedly, and she&apos;s clearly still in love. And in the chorus she says, “Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you.” OK, you know the song. What if she had sung it like this? (Singing) Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you. What happened? I apologize, by the way. (Laughter) In my version, we believe her. We believe she will find someone like you. No problem, there&apos;s plenty of you out there. Because I have paired stable notes in the key and stable chords, bringing a feeling of stability. But that&apos;s not the melody she sang. Those weren&apos;t the tones that she sang. This is her version. (Singing) “Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you.” (Laughter) Do you feel the difference? (Laughter) So when she sang “Nevermind,” she sang it on the most stable note in the major key. When she sang “find someone,” she sang it on that note that you all wanted me to resolve back to the home note. (Singing) &quot;Find someone.&quot; And then she sings “you” on the bittersweet sixth degree of the major scale, breaking your heart. (Singing) &quot;You.&quot; (Laughter) In her version, we know she will never find (Crying voice) anyone like you. (Laughter) We know that because she has paired unstable pitches to match the way she&apos;s feeling, building empathy with the audience. Go, Adele. (Laughter) Another way that songwriters emotionalize our lyrics is the use of chords. Chords are just three to four notes played at the same time. (Plays piano) Three, four. And chords have a lot to say about how our lyrics feel. So let&apos;s say I want to write a song about eating a Snickers bar. And let&apos;s say that I feel amazing about eating that Snickers bar, because they just came out with a fat-free vegan version. (Laughter) I would want to make sure that I picked chords that felt as happy about this news as I do. (Singing) Today I ate a Snickers bar. But what if ... What if that wasn&apos;t the case? What if I was despondent or very upset about the fact that I&apos;m eating the Snickers bar because it was my ex&apos;s favorite Snickers bar? It was his favorite candy bar, and it was the last thing we ate together. (Laughter) (Singing) Today I ate a Snickers bar. (Laughter) So chords. Chords help us define the mood of the song. Another tool that we use is repetition. Because repetition helps our listener remember our song and sing with us. So again, I&apos;m going to play something and I want you to be honest. I want you to raise your hand when you start to get bored. (Laughter) (Singing) You are the world&apos;s greatest audience. You are the world&apos;s greatest audience. You are the world&apos;s greatest audience. (Laughter) I&apos;m hurt. (Laughter) Exactly how did we all know that, right? Because in songwriting, there&apos;s the rule of three. You can&apos;t repeat the same melody exactly the same way three times in a row. Something&apos;s got to change that third time. Maybe I could have changed a chord. (Singing) You are the world&apos;s greatest audience. Or maybe the melody. (Singing) You are the world&apos;s greatest audience. So our brains love patterns, but our brains also love surprise. So I set up a pattern, and then I surprised you and you were reengaged. But too much repetition causes the brain to habituate and zone out. Too much repetition is a sonic cliche, and our listener stops listening. How many times have you said to your partner, in the same melodic stratosphere, &quot;Honey, pick up your towels!&quot; (Laughter) &quot;Honey, pick up your towels!&quot; Like, after thousands of repetitions, their brain has habituated to your wife-voice -- (Laughter) and they don&apos;t hear you. They really don&apos;t. They really don&apos;t. So try changing your melody in some way. (Laughter) Next time, go, &quot;Honey, pick up your towels.&quot; (Laughter) Songs help us process emotion and understand how we feel. When we listen to songs we love, our brain releases the feel-good hormone, dopamine. When we listen to songs we don&apos;t like or hate or bad hold music, our body releases the stress hormone, cortisol. So try a little bit of this brain science for yourself at home. Pick a song in the morning to start your day with. Instead of the usual negative-thought train that blazes through your brain, taking you with it, put on a song you love that has uplifting lyrics that primes your nervous system for a great day. Or the next time you have questionable in-laws coming over -- (Laughter) instead of awkward silences and small talk, put on a song you know they love, and let the dopamine flow. I like to start a song with a great title or a concept or a clear emotion. And then to use the language that&apos;s a mixture of concrete language, metaphor and emotion. And then I use all of the musical elements in support of that idea. As music helps us process negative emotions, as I&apos;ve gotten older, I&apos;ve had to adopt new nouns to my vocabulary. Words I never thought would belong to me, like jowls. (Laughter) And turkey neck. (Laughter) And most horrifyingly, crepe skin. (Laughter) So in order to process my rage, (Laughter) I wrote a song about it. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) Alright, so here&apos;s a little bit. (Singing) Crepe skin oh, I’ve got crepe skin I’m just getting started haven’t figured out the journey yet Better than I&apos;ve ever been but now I’ve got a turkey neck I’m wearing scarves like Diane Keaton Turtleneck sweaters in the summer when it’s heating Crepe skin (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) I know you don&apos;t relate, but -- (Laughter) Yes, I was able to laugh at -- I was able to laugh at the aging process and better accept it. And the delivery of my first AARP magazine. (Laughter) Over a year ago -- many of you might know this -- over a year ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And I turned to music for my therapy. In fact, my song was Lizzo&apos;s &quot;About Damn Time.&quot; (Cheers) Yes. (Applause) After a double mastectomy, chemotherapy and going bald, Lizzo’s lyrics, “I’ve been so down and under pressure, I may not be the girl I was or used to be, bitch I might be better.&quot; (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) And the chorus lyric, &quot;I&apos;ve got a feeling I&apos;m going to be alright, OK, it’s about damn time,” became my fight song of optimism and a shot of dopamine. As there were days that I couldn’t face the next round of chemo, and I would get a text message from an old friend or a card in the mail or a knock on the door with a huge bouquet of flowers. And I was filled with love from those simple kindnesses. And that support and that love made me face the next treatment. It really made me start to understand why I loved that old song, &quot;You Are the Wind Beneath My Wings,&quot; because I literally felt lifted by the love and the friendship that was surrounding me. Because I shared what I was going through, which I felt was really important to do. And their love held me when I couldn&apos;t hold myself. One day, one of my favorite songwriters texted me, and he said, “How are you?” And I said, &quot;It&apos;s going to take everything I&apos;ve got to get through this.&quot; And he texted back, &quot;Well, it&apos;s a good thing you&apos;ve got everything.&quot; But I&apos;m a songwriter. So that idea -- (Laughter) which he will get no credit for -- (Laughter) I held on to that idea because I thought that’s where ideas come to --  [that’s] where ideas come to me from. And one day my dear friend and artist Susan Cattaneo came to visit and I said, &quot;I&apos;m ready to start processing some of this. I&apos;d like to write a song.&quot; And I told her about that idea, and we sat down. And of course, the first instinct could have been the minor key, because -- (Playing piano) That&apos;s where we sort of feel that sadness or darkness belongs. But I was feeling a lot more complicated and complex than that. I was feeling sadness, but I was feeling fear, but it was all lined with sunlight and hope because of all my amazing friends and the community around me. And so we decided to write it in a major key altering one note. So it was a blend of darkness and light. From the major key, we got the major. And then altering one note, we sort of got a little bit of the darkness. In psychology, there’s a term: “name it to tame it.” And when we listen to songs that give name to how we feel or we write them, we can transmute and metabolize difficult emotions. And I felt better on the other side of this song. And I&apos;d like to dedicate it to anyone here that&apos;s facing the hardest thing. (Playing piano) (Singing) The room went out of focus When I heard that diagnosis Words I never thought I&apos;d hear I told my family then my friends As we all tried to pretend That nothing bad ever happens here But then there were cards and calls and flowers at my door I don&apos;t feel so alone anymore It&apos;s gonna take everything I&apos;ve got It&apos;s gonna take everything I&apos;ve got Everything to get me through It&apos;s gonna take everything I&apos;ve got Everything I&apos;ve got Everything to see me through So it&apos;s a good thing That I&apos;ve got everything My head was spinning with a thousand split decisions With my fragile faith and a rose quartz in my hand But then family, friends and neighbors The kindness of strangers When I think that I can&apos;t do this They make me think I can And it&apos;s gonna take everything I&apos;ve got Everything I&apos;ve got Everything to get me through It&apos;s gonna take everything I&apos;ve got Everything I&apos;ve got Everything to see me through So it&apos;s a good thing That I&apos;ve got everything &apos;Cause love Love is a real thing And love Love is a real thing And it&apos;s the only thing And it&apos;s everything we&apos;ve got It&apos;s everything we&apos;ve got Everything to get us through It&apos;s gonna take everything we&apos;ve got Everything we&apos;ve got Everything to get us through So it&apos;s a good thing That we&apos;ve got everything (Music stops) (Applause)"

What we have is actually a food policy crisis. We have the answer, actually, in our food biodiversity. We have over 1,200 grains, over 600 edible roots, not to mention more than 550 fruits and 1,600 seafood and many more. And we can find all these food sources in different landscapes. So Indonesia has a very diverse landscape. We have over 17,000 islands across the archipelago, from sea to the mountains, including rainforest, mangrove area, peatland area, arid land area. You know, everything is there. So actually there is no need for one-fits-all diet, because each of these landscapes have their own food sources. For a lot of [the] Indigenous community, these landscapes are a supermarket without bills. So I started Javara 15 years ago with the mission of bringing back forgotten food biodiversity to help Indigenous and smallholder food farmers to improve their lives, while also providing consumers with healthier diets, with products that are also ecological. So of course, I got to travel across Indonesia, spending time with Indigenous community, and to my surprise, places that are so remote and not even touched by the government policy, food policy programs, are well-fed and healthy. Yes, they may not have much cash, but they are [not] lacking of healthy, nutritious food, as long as the natural environment is not being destroyed. So let&apos;s look into the crop diversity that we have. We have grains. We have edible roots. We have fruit-based. We even have tree trunk. And all of these are gluten free. (Laughter) So another example is on our sugar diversity. We have at least four native fruit trees, including coconut for the lowland and coastal area, arenga tree in the forest area. We have arid land with the lontar or palmyra sugar. And then we have nypa in the wetland. But by the way, nypa also produces salt. How bizarre it is. The same plant produces sugar and salt. And every single of these sugars [is] low-glycemic, providing slow-release energy. And they are very sustainable. They can easily be productive at least for another 50 years. Yet the government decided to come up with massive food estates on sugar cane plantations. So let&apos;s deep dive into an example of ube or greater yam. Ube can be found in the wild. Easily domesticated, can grow under the shade of the tree, and it can easily -- you get over 40 kilos each harvest. So this is the type of staple food which you don&apos;t need to destroy the forest, you don&apos;t need to poison our soil, and basically you don&apos;t even need to introduce new type of crop. Unfortunately, the government, the policy for over four decades choose to ignore our food biodiversity, and instead monoculture of rice prevails. Over 98 percent of Indonesians are consuming rice right now. Let&apos;s compare with 1954, where actually it was only 53 percent. The rest was based on cassava, corn, sago and other edible roots. So I have to say, this is embarrassing, and at the same time very frustrating that a country like Indonesia where the food is abundant, we have such high rate on stunting and malnutrition, not to mention the impact of our food policy towards deforestation, land degradation, climate change, natural disasters, impoverishment of our farmers and also poor diet among the population. We do have a vision, actually, on how the policy should be. We need to shift from monoculture to food biodiversity. We need to revive back the heritage food that actually can provide good nutrition for all, while also keeping intact the nature. It is time for us to give a center stage for the food biodiversity. To be able to find the solutions that we need. This is an example of a small village in Central Java, which decided to embark on a journey to nutrify its community, making sure that every household [has] a food garden, cultivating chicken, fish, vegetables, fruits, herbs. And this is interesting because once they did that, they can reduce their grocery costs by 30 percent, improving their household income by 20 percent, increasing class attendance and also improving the student grades. So nutrition matters. Feeding the nation is one thing, but nutrifying the community goes a very long way. So children [are] our future. It is also time for the food policy to also include food culture education into our curriculum, teaching our children about where their food comes from, what [is] the food biodiversity available around them, to embrace their food culture identity, to understand the nutrition that they have and how our food relates with sustainability. So basically, if we can shift the policy to include food biodiversity, we can provide nutrition, good nutrition for all without jeopardizing our nature. It is time for us to invest more in food biodiversity, in the mainstreaming of biodiversity as [a] practical, inclusive [solution] for the future of our food. Not only that we have a food policy crisis, we also have a food identity crisis. For decades, we have been ripped off from our relationship to culture and nature. We have to help the people to go through this crisis of identity, allowing them to understand the importance of heritage food to become the answer, and also to understand that it is the food of the future. Rebranding it, making it sexy and hyped so that it is no longer perceived as a poor man diet. Thank you. (Applause)"
529225,anna_rothschild_what_staying_up_all_night_does_to_your_brain,Anna Rothschild,What staying up all night does to your brain,https://www.ted.com/talks/anna_rothschild_what_staying_up_all_night_does_to_your_brain,"You’re just one Roman Empire history final away from a relaxing spring break. But you still have so much to study! So you decide to follow in the footsteps of many students before you and pull an all-nighter. When you stay up all night, you&apos;re fighting against your body&apos;s natural circadian rhythms. These are the cyclical changes that virtually all living things experience over the course of a 24-hour period— such as sleeping and waking— and they’re heavily influenced by light. But for the moment, you&apos;re alert and powering through the rule of Julius Caesar. As the sun sets, your eyes send signals about the dwindling light to a part of your brain called suprachiasmatic nucleus. This is basically your circadian rhythm’s clock. It alerts your pineal gland to start producing melatonin. That’s the hormone that helps prepare your body for sleep, and levels start to rise about two hours before your normal bedtime. At the same time, neurons in the hypothalamus and brain stem release a compound called GABA. This slows down activity in your brain and can have a calming effect. You’re approaching your normal bedtime. Since the brain needs to cool down before sleep, your core body temperature starts to drop. Huh, that map kind of looks like a face. Uh-oh, your attention has started to drift. Throughout the day, your brain has been releasing a waste product called adenosine. The more adenosine latching onto receptors in your brain, the more tired and inattentive you become. Time for a cup of coffee. Caffeine blocks adenosine from binding to receptors, which can give you a boost of energy. However, it might also make you jittery and increase your anxiety. You’re acing these flashcards! Right now these dates and names are being stored in an area of the brain called the hippocampus. Normally when you go to sleep, memories like these are consolidated and slotted into long-term storage in your brain’s neocortex. So it’s a good thing you only need to remember this information through tomorrow. Microsleeps are unpredictable periods of sleep that last for only a few seconds and are triggered by sleep deprivation. You stretch in an attempt to stay awake. But at this point your motor skills have also taken a hit. Studies have found that people who have been awake for 19 hours have similar coordination and reaction times as those who have been drinking. As the sun rises, your pineal gland stops releasing melatonin. You feel a “second wind” come on. And despite everything, you leave for school in a really good mood. Sleep deprivation can briefly induce euphoria. It&apos;s caused a temporary boost in dopamine levels, which can unfortunately also lead to poor choices. The final starts off well. It’s all multiple choice! But then you get to the essay portion. It’s thought that during sleep, our brains process ideas and draw connections between new memories and old ones. So your sleepless brain might be able to regurgitate facts, but you&apos;re finding it more difficult to find patterns or problem solve. You stare at the blank page, defeated. You head up to your room, anxious and irritable. Your amygdala, the part of the brain involved with processing emotion, is going haywire.  Your prefrontal cortex usually keeps your amygdala in check, but it still isn&apos;t firing on all cylinders. Your bed has never felt so sweet. After one sleepless night, your body and brain bounce back pretty quickly. Which is a good thing since we can’t always control how much sleep we get. But going for long periods without a good night&apos;s sleep or constantly changing your bedtime, can take its toll. Regularly getting less than seven hours of sleep each night  is linked to all sorts of health issues, from diabetes to stroke to chronic pain. It also leaves you more vulnerable to developing mental health issues like depression. Your sleep schedule can even affect your grades. Studies have shown that college students who keep regular sleep hours have, on average, a higher GPA than students who don&apos;t. So the next time you’re thinking of pulling an all-nighter, remember that Rome wasn’t built in a day,  or for that matter, one night."

Yates-Anyabwile,Your relationship expectations could be holding you back,https://www.ted.com/talks/stephanie_r_yates_anyabwile_your_relationship_expectations_could_be_holding_you_back,"I’m a couples therapist and an absolute romance fiend.   I&apos;m talking about everything from &quot;The Notebook&quot; to &quot;Twilight&quot; to a show some of you may remember called &quot;The Flavor of Love.&quot; (Laughter) It&apos;s a reality competition show where the prize was the love of Flavor Flav. (Laughter) I think about relationships a lot, and something that comes up a lot in my work is this belief that relationships are hard. And we believe that due to one primary reason: our metric of success is based on what we&apos;ve seen everyone else do. Imagine how you would honestly feel if you heard the following about another couple. OK, I said honestly. OK? &quot;I heard they don&apos;t even sleep in the same bed anymore.&quot; &quot;They claim they never want to get married.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t think they ever plan to live together.&quot; Would you think to yourself &quot;it sounds like they have some serious issues?&quot; If we&apos;re honest, a lot of us would. And it&apos;s not because we&apos;re not open-minded, but we&apos;ve been taught that these are warning signs for a relationship in trouble. And while they can be for a lot of people, that is not always the case. Relationship experts have found that one of the primary obstacles that couples face are their own expectations. When we compare ourselves to societal norms, we can develop a sense of resentment toward our partner, as well as a sense of shame for how we ourselves are coming up short. Now, before we really get into this, I have to say that some of us have to reckon with the fact that we may be with the wrong person. And that will be clear if your deepest desire is that your partner change fundamental aspects of who they are. You really want them to be a different person. But if you&apos;re confident that you&apos;re with the right person and you just still feel frustrated and dissatisfied, we may find that rejecting everything we&apos;ve known about good relationships is the key to actually having one. I work with couples every day, and I help them through relational crises. I remember I was working with an engaged couple for about a year, and when they first came to me, they said, &quot;We&apos;re 95 percent good. We just want to address the five percent.&quot; And I hear something to this effect often when I first meet a couple. It turns out that five percent was more like 75 percent and increasing. They were struggling to make a blended family work. One partner had kids, the other one had never lived with kids before, and they moved in together after only knowing each other for three months. (Laughter) One time I went on vacation, and by the time I got back, they&apos;d called off their wedding. But why? Their love was, honestly, it was evident, and they were not cruel to each other. Their issue was figuring out how to continue building their romantic relationship while also figuring out how to raise teenagers, who, to be honest, already had two very involved parents, they weren&apos;t really in need of a third. After a particularly big blow up over chores and responsibilities, I finally asked a dangerous question. I said, &quot;Do you think that living together has hurt or helped your relationship more?&quot; We took a few weeks to explore that question, and they decided to test it out. They got a short-term lease on an apartment nearby for the partner who didn&apos;t have kids. And we were really strategic. We made a contract. Let&apos;s talk about dates. Let&apos;s talk about expectations while you guys are living separately. And by the time they came back to me, I&apos;d never seen them communicate so well. They said that they were looking forward to every weekend that they got to spend together. It felt like a vacation because they would spend the entire week planning their time together and savoring every moment they had together. They also found that their individual relationships with the kids drastically improved, without the pressure of trying to transition them into an entirely new household dynamic, especially when they only had a couple years left in the house. So at this point, some of you may be asking yourselves, &quot;What kind of couples therapist recommends that couples live apart?&quot; (Laughter) That&apos;s a fair question. And to be honest, for a majority of my clients, this solution would not work. And that is the point. When we&apos;re thinking about our relationships, we have to avoid focusing on what is normal. There&apos;s no such thing as normal when we&apos;re talking about two unique individuals with their own backgrounds and their own values. For this particular couple, they had to figure out a way to separate their romantic relationship from what really boiled down to roommate issues. And they had a circumstance that supported the option to live apart. One conflict that comes up a lot in my work is the difference in values between arriving on time and arriving looking and feeling your best. Neither one is wrong. But I had a great model for this with my parents. When I was growing up, we drove absolutely everywhere separately. Everywhere. You know, if you&apos;re going to be a little bit late, you would ride with my mom and if you’re arriving on time, you’d go with my dad. They had two minivans for only two kids. OK. We didn&apos;t go anywhere together. And one time when I was about 12 years old, one of my closest friends finally worked up the courage to ask me about it. And I could tell she was so nervous. Like I was about to reveal to her that my parents were secretly separated, and she just figured it out. You know, now that I think about it, I bet her mom put her up to this. (Laughter) What&apos;s interesting is that her parents did go on to get divorced, and my parents stayed together for 23 years before my mom passed away. Now do I think that’s due to them commuting separately? Of course not. But I think it shows us two things. First, it shows us that any deviation from the norm can be met with curiosity and even judgment. It also shows us that sometimes, when we decide to do things a little differently, we can avoid the difference between having a really challenging day as a couple or a smooth day, by simply accepting our differences not as a couple, but as individuals. Instead of trying to change our partners, what if we instead embraced their differences, our difference in values, and release the pressure of doing what everyone else is doing? It&apos;s OK to be a stay-at-home dad. It&apos;s OK if you prefer to travel without each other. It&apos;s OK if you need to have your own bedrooms so you can maintain personal space and be sane for each other. It&apos;s OK if you want to break tradition and create a new last name. It&apos;s OK if you want to share your love on social media, but it&apos;s also OK if you want to protect it from public opinion. It&apos;s OK if you&apos;re in a season of life where you both just cannot prioritize sex. It&apos;s OK if people are confused about your relationship. It was never theirs to understand in the first place. (Applause) If we continue to accept the narrative that relationships are hard, then we&apos;ll continue to do nothing about it. If our relationships feel hard, I encourage us to reflect on what is hard about it. Is it really the relationship or is it external factors like our own personal trauma histories or work stress? If it really is your relationship, let&apos;s really think about what you and your partner are willing to do differently to enjoy it again. I want us to reject everything we&apos;ve ever known about relationships, and challenge ourselves to create a relationship that not only defies expectations but honors the peculiarities that make us, us. Thank you. (Applause)"
551212,alex_rosenthal_can_you_solve_the_trickster_god_riddle,Alex Rosenthal,Can you solve the trickster god riddle?,https://www.ted.com/talks/alex_rosenthal_can_you_solve_the_trickster_god_riddle,"Ragnarok has been raging for far too long; many gods and heroes have fallen, and the rest can barely stand. Loki, his bright eyes dimmed by exhaustion, asks to meet. He proposes that you and he settle the conflict with a game atop a sacred table engraved with your names. It has the following rules: one player will carve any number of crosses into the table, then play begins. Each turn, the active player must carve a line connecting two open ends without touching itself or another line. Then, he must carve a short segment across that new line and pass the knife to the other player. Only crosses and end-of-turn segments are in play. Whoever makes the last valid move wins and will rule the new world. Loki will let you carve however many crosses you want into the table, then he’ll choose whether he goes first or second. You’re certain the trickster is up to something, so how can you beat him? Pause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Often the best way to analyze a game like this— which was invented by John Conway under the name Brussels Sprouts— is to try it out. Let’s start with the simplest case: a single cross. Here, no matter how we play, the game ends in three moves. With two crosses, the game always ends in eight. And with three crosses, 13 moves. That’s a bad sign if it continues— however many crosses you carve, Loki could choose the turn order and win. But this pattern doesn’t necessarily mean that every game is fixed— perhaps 10 or 15 or 100 crosses has some winnable condition. So let&apos;s try to understand what&apos;s happening. We can start by looking at the final states of a few games. As chaotic as they seem, there’s something interesting here. Every game ends with a number of distinct regions, each with exactly one line poking in. The one cross game has four— these three, and the one outside the blob. Two crosses produces eight regions, and three crosses, 12. That makes sense; each cross started with exactly four points that we could carve from— we can think of those as lives. Each turn removes two ends, then adds two more. But when one is stuck by itself in an enclosure, it’s unusable and we lose a life. By the end of the game all but one of those lives has been claimed by an enclosed shape, with the last poking out into the great blank beyond. And when do we make an enclosed shape? Almost always. In this game, we closed one off there, and there, and there. Sometimes they immediately claim a life, but sometimes it happens later to two at once, like when we divide a region in half. But even that move added one more region than we previously had— we turned one into two. The only time we don’t create a new enclosure is when we connect two separate clusters, like this. A cluster might involve a single cross or a blob that’s formed around multiple. We never end up with an enclosed region without a line, because whenever we make a region, we carve a new segment, half of which pokes in. We also never end with a region with multiple lines, because then we could connect them and divide the region further. So back to the single cross game. We start with four lives in one giant region. After we carve the first line, we have two regions. After the second line, three regions. And after the third, four, so we’re done. Adding a second cross gives us four more lives, and also a free move that doesn’t make an enclosure, whenever we choose to connect these two clusters. The third cross adds four more lives and another free move. So that’s why the total number of turns goes up by five each time— four extra lives plus one free move. All of which is to say: Loki, true to form, has rigged the game. The only way to win is to trick the trickster... and there is something he overlooked. Let&apos;s say you carve one cross. Loki chooses to go first, anticipating a quick and easy win on turn three. So when, on your first move, you carve a line all the way  to the last letter in your name, his triumphant sneer passes through shock, dismay, and rage. But rules are rules, and a cross is a cross."

Meaning an entrepreneur, but within a larger company. Didn&apos;t mean to. When I started at Intuit in 2020, my job was to do marketing and advertising for QuickBooks, but it was in that position that I saw an opportunity, an opportunity for Intuit, to help connect our small-business customers with complementary products and services that would help them grow and thrive, while also being good for our business. Now, I sat on the idea for a while, really wanting to focus on the work that was right in front of me, but I couldn&apos;t shake it. So I eventually pulled together a proposal, brought it to our leadership team, and much to my surprise, they said, “Go pursue it.” And it was at that moment I started making every mistake possible in trying to bring it to life. But through those mistakes, I&apos;ve learned what it means to be a successful intrapreneur, and I&apos;m going to share those mistakes today in the hopes that if there&apos;s anyone that has an idea and wants to build something from within, that this can be helpful. So the first lesson I learned was to socialize your vision early and often. I had romanticized the idea of a skunkworks-like start-up within Intuit. I built a lean team. We worked in the shadows. Everything was on a need-to-know basis. The more people that got involved, the more process, the more bureaucracy, the more opinions, it was just going to slow us down. And it worked, but not very long. The problem was, as we started to grow and become a legitimate business, I needed the support from a lot more teams and I didn&apos;t have it. Some of the most uncomfortable conversations I had with my coworkers was going to someone that I knew was stretched thin, had no idea what I was working on, and telling them that they needed to carve out additional time to help support it. I was not very popular in those moments. In my attempt to move fast, I made us move slow because with every new team that we approached, we were starting from scratch and had to paint that picture over and over again. This is also when I learned the value of a well-placed happy hour or coffee break. So I realized it was really important for me to establish a human connection and not a transactional one. So I&apos;d ask my colleagues to go out and grab a beer or coffee and we would talk. And in those conversations, I would learn about their workload, their resource constraints, about what energizes them and their teams. It was also an opportunity for me to share my vision, why I was excited, and what I thought I could do for our customers and our business. The second lesson that I learned, very similar to the first, but on the flip side, is this idea of listening early and often. I’d been in marketing for almost 20 years at that point. I&apos;d worked on Super Bowl ads, global brand campaigns. I thought I knew everything that there was to know about marketing and advertising. And because of that, I had a crystal-clear picture in my head of how I wanted every piece to work in this new initiative. When someone would say that something wasn&apos;t possible or had a difference of opinion, I immediately labeled them as blockers. They were either not understanding what we were doing, they were scared or simply just didn&apos;t want to do the hard thing. The truth was, I was grossly overconfident in my understanding of everything. I knew very little about corporate accounting principles. I knew enough to be dangerous about things like privacy law, and those &quot;blockers&quot; were actually deeply invested in the success and were trying to prevent me from making the mistakes that would get the project killed. And to be clear, I was making a lot of mistakes. It&apos;s only because of them that the project not only lived on, but thrived. Listening became so important to the project that we implemented something that we called dumb-question sessions. These were a safe-place, judgment-free zones where myself and others could ask questions that maybe we were nervous to ask in other forums, maybe because we should have known the answer to those, maybe because it&apos;s obvious to the rest of the organization, but just because of the role that we sit in, we were never exposed to it. Regardless, the purpose of it was to have a shared understanding of all parts of our business. I remember one specific example where there was an acronym that had been used for weeks, and I didn&apos;t know what it was. I didn&apos;t ask early on. So much time had gone by that I felt like I was trapped. I didn&apos;t want to ask at that point. I thought I was going to have to live with this lie for the rest of my life. But it was because of the dumb-question session and the judgment-free zone that I was able to ask and fill in all the gaps. And actually, one note on that last example, I&apos;m pretty sure there was a little bit of judgment, but I think I deserved it. So the last lesson that I learned, and the one that I feel is most important and possibly counterintuitive, is that the stakes can be quite high. Your personal risk tolerance doesn&apos;t matter. If you go out and start your own business and it fails, it is not a good thing. It can add stress to your family, obviously financial implications. Intuit was founded on trying to make sure that that doesn&apos;t happen, but if it does, it&apos;s relatively contained. If I were to do something that compromises our customers&apos; trust in our products and our brand, or create a poor product experience for our QuickBooks product, the implications can be far-reaching. It can impact a lot of small businesses. You can&apos;t shoot from the hip. That&apos;s not to say that you need to work out of a sense of fear, either. You just have to be super thoughtful about how every decision you make, how every action you take, could impact the broader organization. To wrap up, again, if you are someone that has an interesting idea that you feel like you want to build from within, I encourage you, work with the system. There is a lot of horsepower built up in these large organizations. Lean on the experts, learn from them. Will you go a little bit slower at times? Yes. Will you make compromises that you didn&apos;t want to make? Absolutely. Will the product be better for it? One hundred percent. And that&apos;s what you want. And that&apos;s what it takes to be successful. Thank you. (Applause)"
553513,dana_r_fisher_how_to_be_an_apocalyptic_optimist,Dana R. Fisher,"How to be an ""apocalyptic optimist""",https://www.ted.com/talks/dana_r_fisher_how_to_be_an_apocalyptic_optimist,"I call myself an “apocalyptic optimist,” but I wasn&apos;t always this way. I used to believe that technology could save us from the climate crisis, that all the big brains in the world would come up with a silver bullet to stop carbon pollution, that a clever policy would help that technology spread, and our concern about the greenhouse gases heating the planet would be a thing of the past, and we wouldn&apos;t have to worry about the polar bears anymore. But time and time again, I saw that climate policy and business response were absolutely insufficient. Our big wins have been only small steps in the right direction. Even with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the US is nowhere near meeting its commitments under the Paris Agreement, and the US is not alone. In fact, the US is the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world right now. I&apos;m a sociologist. I study anthro shifts, the process of monumental social change in a warming world. My work is part of the literature that documents why governments and businesses are failing to address the climate crisis effectively. One of the main reasons is that fossil fuel interests have a stranglehold on decision making. Because of their access to resources and power, they have blocked systemic changes that are needed, promoting instead incremental policies and even climate denial. It&apos;s time for us to face reality, and it&apos;s a bitter pill. The question isn&apos;t will climate change affect us. It&apos;s how many lives will be lost to the growing climate crisis? I still believe we can save ourselves from this crisis that humans created, though not all of us equally. Unfortunately, the mountains of data I&apos;ve collected from policymakers, business representatives and activists show that saving ourselves is only possible with a mass mobilization of civil society that&apos;s driven by the pain and suffering of climate shocks around the world. These shocks come in the form of heat waves, droughts, fires and floods. As climate shocks come more frequently and hit with more severity, they will lead to additional social conflict as areas become uninhabitable, resource scarcity grows and people move to avoid the effects of climate change. So that&apos;s the apocalyptic part. But here&apos;s where the optimism comes in. As our world warms and more people experience the effects of the climate crisis firsthand, there&apos;s evidence that climate shocks and the conflicts they motivate will get people out in the street demanding action. Civil society will build political pressure to force governments and businesses to shift away from fossil fuels. We&apos;re already seeing glimpses of this process in action. In 2023, I surveyed participants to the March to End Fossil Fuels in New York City. Over 75 percent of the 75,000 or so activists who participated reported personally experiencing the effects of climate change. This summer, my research found that 79 percent of participants in the Summer of Heat campaign to stop fossil fuel expansion had experienced climate shocks in the past six months. These activists engaged in non-violent civil disobedience, like singing and chanting and blocking buildings dressed as orcas and even hot dogs -- yep, hot dogs -- to send a message to big banks like Citibank and convince them to stop funding fossil fuel projects. It’s time for us to all be apocalyptic optimists: prepared for the shocks that are coming and ready to rally as activists, disruptors and bridge builders. Together, we can pressure the state and the market to adopt the changes that our communities require to survive. Here&apos;s my advice about how to be the change makers we need. First, activism and engagement must create community and solidarity. This is how we get over that necessary threshold and mobilize the masses. I&apos;ve studied countless social movements, and the most effective and durable ones are those that bring people together across a diversity of identities and orientations. One of the reasons that the first Women&apos;s March in 2017 was the largest single day of protest in US history, is because its message resonated with people on an individual personal level. Although it was a women&apos;s march and the majority of participants reported turning out to show support for women&apos;s rights, people of color came out because they were also concerned about racial justice, and Latino participants joined because they were also worried about immigration policy under the first Trump administration. To date, the climate movement does not do a great job of connecting activists across identities, orientations or social classes. But it needs to. Second, disruption, repression and even violence can help jolt sympathizers to take action. The type of activism that I&apos;m talking about is not going to be peaceful, not because the activists are likely to get violent, but because those in power often do. Already, activists in Europe, the UK and the United States are being threatened and criminalized, with many facing jail time for blocking traffic, for organizing sit-ins or for throwing soup or smearing paint on the protective covering of artwork. It&apos;s much harder for activists in the developing world. Almost 200 environmental defenders are murdered each year because of their activism. Research shows that social movements get more confrontational as their struggles continue. This so-called “radical flank” involves tactics like blocking streets and occupying public spaces. Although these tactics are super unpopular, they are a necessary component of social movements as they expand and build capacity for social change by channeling sympathetic individuals into more moderate components of the movement. This process is what we call the “radical flank effect,” even though the tactics are frequently not particularly radical. Sympathizers are also mobilized to participate by witnessing violence against peaceful protesters. During the US civil rights movement, watching violence against activists motivated members of the broader population to join the movement. In 2020, when activists protesting the murder of George Floyd in Washington, DC, near the White House were tear-gassed, the crowds that turned out the following day were much larger. Third, you don&apos;t have to be an activist to make a difference. We don&apos;t all need to get arrested protesting, but we must all work together to make our communities more resilient in the face of climate shocks. As the climate movement builds and grows and builds capacity, the climate crisis rages on. If we work to cultivate resilience in our communities, we can help to limit the human suffering that will come as the world warms. To be more resilient and to recover more quickly from the effects of climate change, service corps programs are popping up across the United States. When Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Puerto Rico in 2017, AmeriCorps deployed its members to help with disaster response, rebuilding and reconnecting food delivery to communities across the island. Similar programs are currently underway in mountain communities and others affected by hurricane Helene and hurricane Milton. This type of program is also popping up across Europe and Africa to build resilience. They support young people as well as older adults, training them to weatherize homes, install rooftop solar, remove debris from forested areas and to build more dense civic networks to support communities when disaster hits. These programs are much more effective when they connect people where they live, work and experience climate shocks. Because so much more is possible when we already know one another. Rather than parachuting in strangers during times of crisis. As unfair as it may seem, the future is up to us. These times will not be easy or pain-free. But unless we get realistic about the path that we are on, too many of us will be caught off guard. Some days it&apos;s hard to be an apocalyptic optimist. More climate records are broken. Extreme weather hits. Or another round of climate negotiations takes place and ends in a petrostate, with no measurable effects whatsoever on the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But then I see communities pushing back. They vote to phase out natural gas and local buildings. They pressure banks to stop investing in fossil fuel infrastructure, or they work with their friends and neighbors to muck and gut buildings destroyed by flood or fire. As I witness these local people investing their time and energy in building communities that are more capable of withstanding the shocks that are yet to come, I&apos;m optimistic once again. Thank you. (Applause)"
547179,katsuhiko_hayashi_a_mouse_with_two_dads_and_a_new_frontier_for_biology,Katsuhiko Hayashi,A mouse with two dads — and a new frontier for biology,https://www.ted.com/talks/katsuhiko_hayashi_a_mouse_with_two_dads_and_a_new_frontier_for_biology,"It is my great pleasure to be here to share some news from biology today with you. So your life and mine starts with this. The union of sperm and egg. The fertilization involves sperm from the father and egg from the mother. They meet in the usual way, and the fertilized egg acquires the potential to give rise to the individuals like you and me. If you trace back your generations, you are derived from your parents, and your parents are derived from your grandparents, and so on, in distant past. This perpetuity can only be achieved through what biologists like me call germ cell lineage. These are the only cells that are immortal among more than 200 types of cells in your body. The rest die with you. So these immortal germs, called gametes, are very important, and we call them germline. In our society, this unbroken line is under threat. The present generations are having children later and later, and the older germ cells are less likely to result in successful fertilization, which leads to the declining birth rate. It&apos;s not just the people. The continuous decrease in the reproductive rate of large livestock has resulted in huge economic losses. Setting aside the human needs, there are endangered animals down to a few individuals. How can we preserve them? That is where the assisted reproductive technology offers hope. Since Robert Edwards successfully combined human germ cells in a dish, more than 20 million babies have been born through this technology called in vitro fertilization. However, current assisted reproductive technology can only be applied if sperm and egg can be obtained from the body. If not, there are no options available. But I would ask now: Can we create germ cells in a dish? So this is a question. So let&apos;s start with how the germ cells form in the body. After fertilization, a fertilized egg undergoes cell divisions and differentiates into the different cell types. As it further develops, original cells, or eventual sperm and egg, known as the primordial germ cells, emerge. These primordial germ cells then differentiate into the primary egg, known as the oocyte, in the female, or spermatogonia, the precursor of the sperm in the male. These egg and sperm mature over time, which is associated with the sexual maturation of individuals. Now imagine if this entire process were to occur outside the body. So my team and I have been focusing on duplicating this entire process in a dish, known as in vitro gametogenesis. The key to generating the germ cells in a dish is a type of cells called pluripotent stem cells, because they each have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body. Martin Evans showed that such a pluripotent stem cell could be derived from preimplantation embryo in mice, and James Thomson showed it could be done in humans. Based on these breakthroughs, Shinya Yamanaka showed that any kind of cell in the body could be turned into the pluripotent stem cells simply by expressing a specific set of proteins. These are called induced pluripotent stem cells, and they possess the same potential as those derived from embryos. By using these pluripotent stem cells, we can hijack the germline. During normal development, cells receive a signal that guides their differentiation into the different cell types. By mimicking the right signals, pluripotent stem cells can be directed along the pathway to differentiate into the egg and sperm. This has been successfully demonstrated in our laboratory by using mouse pluripotent stem cells. By providing appropriate signals, we were able to generate mature eggs from most pluripotent stem cells. Also to achieve this, we created a mini ovary from pluripotent stem cells, allowing the oocyte to mature outside the body. Importantly, eggs produced in a dish are capable of fertilization and giving rise to yet more mice like these. These looks the same as any other mice. They grow up, they eat the food, they breed and live long. But in this case, the genetic mother of these mice is the pluripotent stem cell grown in a dish. With this in vitro gametogenesis, the process of creating an egg requires only skin cells or other easily collectable cells from the body, even cells in urine. So this means actually this kind of technology can be applied to the various mammalian species, including humans, livestock or even endangered animals. Several research groups have successfully produced the primordial germ cells from pluripotent stem cells in all these cases. Notably, our laboratory is actively involved in the repopulation effort for the northern white rhinoceros. Sadly, there are only two females who remain on this planet. We have generated the egg precursors from the northern white rhinoceros induced pluripotent stem cells, and are currently creating a mini ovary system to mature these precursors into the eggs. But we can go further than [that]. By using this technology, we can skip the sex-dependent reproduction. Today, germ cells have different shape and different function based on the sex. This difference is genetically made by the sex chromosome. In the human, males have an X and Y chromosome, and the females have two X chromosomes. From a genetic viewpoint, this is the only difference between male and female. But in a dish, we can eliminate this difference. So our laboratory succeeded in the switching from the XY chromosome to the X chromosome. How did we do that? Well, we took the skin cells from the male mice, and then made induced pluripotent stem cells, which have X and Y chromosomes, of course. Then we made a lot of these cells. In some rare populations, unequal segregation of sex chromosomes occurs during cell division, which means some XY chromosomes become one X chromosome that then doubles and becomes two X chromosomes. We picked that very rare population of these cells that have two X chromosomes, and we made an egg. The egg derived from sex-converted induced pluripotent stem cells behaves exactly [like an] egg from traditional females. We then fertilized the sex-converted egg with the sperm, and this gave rise to typical healthy mice like these. They grow up, they eat the food, they mate and live long, just like conventionally bred mice. The only difference is these are derived from two dads. Looking at the history of reproductive technology like this, technologies developed in experimental animals like this can eventually be applied to the human and other animals. Today, the production of egg in a dish, even from traditional male cells, open a new possibility for reproduction in the future. We can create germ cells in a dish, and they can come from two fathers, two mothers or perhaps other combinations. Thank you. (Applause)"
553438,thomas_dohmke_can_europe_win_the_age_of_ai,Thomas Dohmke,Can Europe win the age of AI?,https://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_dohmke_can_europe_win_the_age_of_ai,"Vlad Gozman: Obviously people know you as the CEO of GitHub, you&apos;re at the helm of what I would say is the most pivotal tool for developers worldwide, and also a player early on in the AI game with Copilot. But before we go into all that and GitHub, I want to go back a bit. I&apos;m curious, something what people might not know is how did you get here? Thomas Dohmke: I took a plane from Stuttgart to fly here. But I think you&apos;re asking about my life&apos;s journey. I was born in East Berlin in 1978, and so for the first 12 years of my life, I didn&apos;t really have access to computers. There was a Robotron, an East German clone of a Z80 I think, in the geography lab that we were allowed to hack a little bit on. And then I bought a Commodore 64 in the early &apos;90s. And, you know, it&apos;s been forgotten what that was like, right? I had to buy like a yellow book. It was literally called the big Commodore 64 book. And then you taught yourself coding, and there was no internet to go, right? There was no forum, no Reddit, no GitHub. You had to either figure it out yourself, or you had to go to computer club on Wednesday and hope there&apos;s another nerd there that knows the answer to your question. In 1998, I started university at Technical University in Berlin. And, you know, one of the big benefits was that you had a landline internet connection from there that didn&apos;t cost any money compared to AOL and CompuServe. And I bought SUSE Linux in the bookstore to get into the world of open source. And obviously, I found lots of other nerds on the internet to ask all the questions in the newsgroups, the Usenet. And you know, went through my career journey. And when the iPhone SDK came out in 2008, I thought, it&apos;s time to do something new. I quit my job at Bosch at the height of the financial crisis in late 2008, to become an independent software developer that builds iPhone and Android apps. And of course, you know, through the cloud, I was able to also distribute all my apps and then later build a platform called Hockey App that was acquired by Microsoft in 2014. And that then moved me from Stuttgart all the way to Seattle, where I got lucky in 2018 to be in the right time, right place to be part of the GitHub acquisition. And ultimately, you know, be here on stage as the GitHub CEO. VG: What a journey. It all has led to this moment. (Applause) But, you know, it raises an interesting point, right? You&apos;ve been successful here in Europe up to a point. And then you left. I mean, your further steps were even more successful, I would argue. But you left. So my next question is, you know, how do we keep the next Thomas Dohmke in Europe? What does Europe need to do? TD: Microsoft made me leave. You have to say it like that. Although, being honest, it also was always a dream of mine to live on the West Coast, in the ’90s, when I was a kid, I felt I was born too late to be part of the home computer revolution. But then obviously now where we are today, it&apos;s clear that there was another one with mobile, another one with cloud, and now we are in one with AI. And so I think, you know, maybe if Microsoft buys a German company today, they would just say you can work from home as hybrid work or remote-only work. It’s much more prevalent than it was 10 years ago in 2014. That said, though, you know, if I look at my hometown in Germany, I can come up with three things that are definitely lacking. And the first one is school and schooling, which, it&apos;s ridiculous to me that we don&apos;t teach kids in first grade how to code like, we teach kids physics, biology and chemistry that you almost never use in life anymore. But we don&apos;t teach them how to build software for their smartphones and for their computers that we all use day in and day out, right? Like, think about that for a second. These are the most important devices in our lives. You know it because you can barely meet anyone that doesn&apos;t have their phone in their hands anymore. Whether it’s in the subway or on a plane or at work. So I&apos;d say schooling needs to dramatically change. And, you know, it&apos;s easy to blame the system and think about, oh, the politics have to change something. I think it starts with us as parents to really encourage the schools to think ahead and think outside the box of what frontal lessons are and used to be when we went to school. The second one is start-up and the start-up ecosystem. It&apos;s so hard to found a company in Germany and Austria and in many European countries. The GmbH has to go away. That&apos;s just the fact. You see a lot of German start-ups that the first thing they do is they go on Stripe Atlas and click in a Delaware LLC, because that&apos;s much easier to collect angel investments, right? We have so much regulation in Europe, GDPR, you know, DSA, DMA, you name it, that start-ups need to follow instead of building cool shit, right? Like that&apos;s I think the biggest issue we have where we need to build a new ecosystem ... Because we know from the innovator’s dilemma that disruption is coming from start-ups. The big incumbents cannot create disruption. There&apos;s exceptions, of course. And, you know, hopefully GitHub and Microsoft are seen as one. But the regular mode is that start-ups are the companies, the founders are the ones that are pushing society forward. And then lastly, you know, infrastructure. You know, my hometown, on their web page, they&apos;re saying 95 percent of all households have broadband internet. But what they mean is 50 Mbit. That&apos;s not broadband. When my kids stream Netflix or YouTube and play Minecraft with their friends and have a WhatsApp chat open all at the same time, I can no longer, you know, join the Zoom call with you to prepare this session. And I think this is where the European Union ultimately needs to go in and have an infrastructure package, and not bridges and streets and all that. That&apos;s that&apos;s good too. But like broadband internet, fiber everywhere. VG: Well, some might argue that regulation is good. How do you stand on that? TD: Regulation is good if you&apos;re a big company with a big law department and big enterprise customers, because then you can go into a sales process and say, here, I check all the boxes, so you don&apos;t have to argue with the legal team and the DPA. Instead, you can just, you know, go through the sales process much quicker. But it&apos;s not good for open-source innovation. It&apos;s not good for small start-ups that do not want to spend all their money on billable hours for, you know, consulting company or for a law firm. And so there needs to be exceptions in those regulations. Innovation needs to be focused on enabling researchers, open-source developers and start-up founders to move really quickly. And then if they reach a certain size, when they actually become relevant to the system. Same with banking, right? When they become relevant to the system, that&apos;s when the regulation, the strongest regulation needs to apply. VG: And do you see, you know like, we lived through this really fast-paced, really, really fast-paced environment with AI. Do you see it now leveling the playing field internationally? And again, with a bit of a perspective on Europe. How does that change the game for a small company, a start-up from Germany, for instance? TD: I think it changes the game from two sides and one is actually on my shirt, it says, “Copilot speaks my language,” because you can use Copilot, ChatGPT, almost all these AI chatbots in the language you grew up with. Here in Austria and Germany, it&apos;s German, right? Most six-year-olds, seven-year-olds, first-, second-graders, they speak mostly German or Croatian or Italian, Spanish, while the open source and the software industry are mostly English speaking. And so if you want to learn coding because you have already played Super Mario or Minecraft, you don&apos;t want to learn English first, what you want to do is build a little game because that&apos;s what humans want to do, they want to create something. And so they can now approach this by just asking in German, how do I create a snake game or pong game or how do I build a Minecraft extension? And they don’t need parents at home that have a technical background, right? Like, if you don&apos;t have anyone at home without AI that can help you when you&apos;re stuck. And that&apos;s the most important moment when you learn something is when you&apos;re stuck, how do you unstuck yourself so you&apos;re not frustrated and just throw it away and go back scrolling through TikToks? That&apos;s the moment where AI is really helpful, and that&apos;s where I believe there&apos;s a huge democratization going to happen. And it&apos;s already happening in countries like India or Brazil. The second piece is, you know, Europe has slept through the cloud transformation, like, most European countries are way behind on the cloud transformation. If you look in, you know, the Dräger report that came out a couple of weeks ago, of the top 50 tech companies, only four are European. And I&apos;m sure most of you cannot actually name those four. I can only name one, SAP. And in the last 50 years, there has been not a single European company that has been founded that has reached more than 100 billion in market capitalization, while the six trillion-dollar companies in the US all have been founded in the last 50 years. That&apos;s where the opportunity with AI is, we get a fresh start. We don&apos;t need to catch up on the cloud as much as we need to be all-in on AI. And it starts all with you, right? We can always blame it on the politics and on the system and on our bosses. It starts with all of us embracing this new technology. I&apos;m assuming that&apos;s why you&apos;re here today. And hopefully tomorrow you&apos;re using some AI in your life, or figuring out how AI works and how you can leverage AI in your career or your start-up or your team. VG: Yeah, thank you for that. I want to push back, though, a bit, because it sounds, and probably this is a criticism that Silicon Valley usually gets, right, it sounds techno-optimistic, right? What about -- A comparison that I&apos;ve always heard is, you know, we&apos;re living through perhaps a new industrial, a new type of industrial revolution, right? When I think back on the Industrial Revolution, the actual one, it had really heavy short-term consequences. So what would you say to somebody who would call you a techno-optimist? TD: What&apos;s wrong with being an optimist, would be my first response. Especially as a German, I think, you know, being optimistic is separating me from the masses. (Laughter) (Applause) I think we, as humans, have the challenge that, you know, we love to focus on the day by day. And the day by day, whether it&apos;s in our lives or in the stock market, often has lots of ups and downs, and we focus heavily on the downs because those are impacting us emotionally much more than the ups. But if we actually zoom out 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, or if I go back to my grandfather&apos;s generation, you know, my father was born in 1939, what life was back then, there is no question that life has gotten massively better. Like, massively. Like, life in Europe, in Germany, in Austria, everywhere here and everywhere around the world has gotten so much better. Our lives are so much more comfortable, our houses are so much warmer, we have food available. And obviously with technology like smartphones, the internet and FaceTime, it&apos;s also much easier to travel all around the world, to live on the other side of the planet. You know, I moved my family almost 10 years ago to Seattle, and we call our parents every weekend on FaceTime. That wasn&apos;t possible, you know, when people immigrated to the United States 100 years ago. It&apos;s indisputable that the world has gotten better. And I think we should have optimism that we can make it better ourselves. But of course, it starts with us, that&apos;s what I said earlier. You know, we need to all have the mindset of: “I can change the world. I can make the world a better place.” My first job after university was with Mercedes-Benz. So back then DaimlerChrysler, and their slogan is “The best or nothing.” I feel like Europe needs to go back to this. We want to be the best in everything. We want to be the best in soccer, right? And we are kind of like the best in Formula One because almost all the Formula One teams are from Europe. But let&apos;s apply that model to all the things that we&apos;re doing and all the ideas that we&apos;re pursuing, all the companies that we&apos;re building, and I think we&apos;re going to create naturally a better world in the long run. VG: Well, I sure hope so. I want to pick up on something you said earlier about us teaching our kids to code very early on. Now AI is changing the game there as well, right? It influences the way we code, perhaps, though, making coders obsolete. So what would you say if like, I would argue OK, you develop technology that makes coders obsolete. Why should we teach our children to code? TD: If you look back at my journey that I described earlier, we could have asked that question at every point of the way, every year. You know, you could have asked me the question when we went from cassette tapes to floppy disks to hard drives. When we went from punch cards that I first saw in my mom&apos;s office in the &apos;80s to assembly language Basic and all of a sudden, higher programming languages. When we went from no open-source at all and we build it all from scratch, or we typed listings from computer magazines. And most of the listings weren&apos;t actually code, they were checksums because you could put more checksums into the box on the page, to the internet and open-source components. Today, no startup anywhere around the world, and no big company anywhere around the world is starting a new project without leveraging open-source components, right? Open-source operating system like Linux, open-source editors like VS Code, open-source container technology like Docker and Kubernetes, thousands of open-source libraries. When you start a new React project, you immediately have hundreds, if not thousands of libraries in your dependency graph. And that means millions of developers have contributed to your project because they built all these open-source libraries, they made your life easier. But they haven’t replaced the demand for software developers. In fact, if you are in software development or if you&apos;re in a company that has software developers, I bet you anything all your feature requests take way too long for your personal perception. Because the developers have effectively two backlogs. They have the innovation backlog. You know, their own ideas, their product manager&apos;s ideas, their customer feedback, all these kind of things, the innovation that drives the company forward. And that&apos;s an endless backlog. I will never be done with the GitHub backlog. I will just retire and give up and somebody else comes in and takes over with my team. And then on the other side we have you know, the tech debt, the compliance requirements, all the European regulations and the California regulations, security, privacy, accessibility, all these other things that you also have to do because if you don&apos;t do them, your customers don&apos;t trust you anymore, you have a security issue, and you have to go to the press and tell them that you lost all the customer data, which is often driving a company close to bankruptcy. And so you have to balance those two backlogs, and they’re both endless. And you can’t only do this one, and you can’t only do that one. So you need to use AI to bring it a little bit down, further down, so developers can actually innovate more. And now with AI they no longer have to only do back end and front end. They have to do back end and front and AI and offline evals and online evals and prompt engineering and new models left and right. So I&apos;m sure there&apos;s a bunch of sessions for that as well. And so I don&apos;t think we are running out of work. I think we are drowning in software. Marc Andreessen said, “Software is eating the world,” over 10 years ago. Software has eaten the world. And we as software developers are drowning in code. And we&apos;re still managing COBOL from the &apos;50s and &apos;60s at the same time. (Applause) VG: So what you&apos;re saying is with AI, even more work for developers. And I know GitHub is sort of aiming for a world where even more developers are enabled to work and cooperate, maybe share a bit of that vision. How would we get to a world where we have not a few hundreds of millions of developers, but over a billion developers, for instance? TD: At GitHub, one of our most important values, if not the most important value,  is that we have the saying, as we always put the developer first in every decision we make, every product design, every process. My HR team is using GitHub. My legal team is using GitHub, which also means red lines are much easier because it’s just a diff and a pull request. And that comes with, you know, the conviction that if you want to put developers first, that means you want to make developers happier. Because happy developers are productive developers, productive developers are innovating and building great software. And so Copilot is following that vision, because we really built copilot back in 2020 because we wanted to make our developers a little bit more productive, a little bit more happy. And we believe, you know, that journey will continue throughout the next years. If you think about the original Copilot, it was just predicting the next line of code, multiple lines of code, complex algorithms, often just boilerplate, you could explain code, you can now document that method, you can write test cases. And you can all do that in natural language. And that building block of a line of code or multiple lines of code is going to grow as the AI becomes more powerful. We will have smaller agents that write a whole module or a class, something that tests all our software so we don&apos;t have to write test cases. I don&apos;t know many developers that love writing test cases. It&apos;s more like, how little test cases can I get away with so I pass code review and can move on to the next cool thing. So we really are on that journey of sparking new ideas, of enabling people to write a short prompt and getting a little mini game, a little web page, a little module, a piece of code that pushes them forward, that lets them stay in their creative flow. I know many people that use Copilot both in their work life, you know, from Monday through Friday, but also are telling me, “This is so great for my hobby projects that I work on on a Sunday afternoon, because I only have limited amount of time and getting back on my hobby is hard if I constantly have to go to my browser and look things up, how things are done instead of just staying in that flow.&quot; So we want to spark ideas, you know, we want to keep developers in the flow, and we want to enable, you know, a billion people on this planet, 60-year-olds, you know, 20-year-olds, 50-year-olds, anyone who wants to learn coding, to learn coding. VG: That&apos;s kind of a great future, if you ask me. Now, before we go, I know we&apos;re running out of time, but, I&apos;m curious. I mean, a lot of people know GitHub here. A lot of people know Copilot. I&apos;m curious if you can share what comes next. What is GitHub working on? TD: So we have our conference coming up, and we have a lot of exciting announcements that I cannot share with you today. (Laughter) But I think, you know, it goes along that journey that I mentioned that we will, you know, introduce a new product that lets you spark new ideas and where you can explore those ideas and build little cool apps. VG: Great, so a nice teaser. Looking forward to finding out more. Thank you a lot. TD: Thank you."

So your government has introduced a plan to address the record-breaking rates  of traffic tickets and deadly hovercar accidents. They propose assigning driver credit scores to every car-owning citizen. Drivers’ scores will go up when they drive in legal and considerate ways, and down when they drive recklessly. Citizens with high scores will then be rewarded with car-related benefits, like easier access to car loans and cheaper gas and toll payments. But drivers with low scores will see the price of those things go up. Your planet&apos;s already tested this system, and researchers found a drastic decrease in car accidents and inconsiderate driving. But to implement this planet-wide, the government needs to observe every driver’s behavior. And because hover cars routinely drive off-road, it won’t be enough simply to surveil the roads— the government will need to install cameras and microphones in every vehicle. The recordings would be stored on government servers to document driver behavior and justify scores. Clearly it would be good for everyone if the roads were safer. But is this undeniable benefit worth the cost to drivers’ privacy? The government has put their controversial plan to a vote. Where do you stand?  Your answer will likely depend on what you think the value of privacy is. Philosophers often understand privacy as the ability to control information about oneself. From this perspective, privacy matters because it impacts how each of us navigates the social world, deciding when and to what extent to be in the public eye. Some think this kind of control is essential to being free, and that any policy which reduces privacy therefore impairs our freedom. For example, living in a surveillance state would likely affect your actions even if no one was using your private information against you. But in cases like your planet’s, the conflict is between your own personal freedom and the good of the larger social world. And since society is really just a collection of individuals with their own rights, how can we determine what the “greater good” even is? For the philosopher Plato, this was very straightforward. He defined justice as referring to the welfare of society as a whole— not the well-being or liberty of its individual members. He likened this to the way we talk about the health of a human body, where the condition of any single limb or organ matters only as part of the bigger picture. For Plato, the same is true of individual members of society; justice requires prioritizing the collective good over their own individual good. On the other hand, other philosophers have defended privacy as a means of moderating the “tyrannical excesses of an unchecked security state.” In the present case, your government could misuse this surveillance data. But even if your government were perfectly trustworthy, some feel your right to privacy would still be an essential cornerstone of democracy. Ruth Gavison notes that the protection of privacy fosters “moral autonomy,” which she argues is necessary for people to exercise their democratic rights. She maintains that democracy depends on people’s ability  to form independent judgments and preferences, and this requires knowing that we&apos;re free from the threat of public hostility or humiliation.  However, perhaps it’s worth questioning whether privacy is really valuable in its own right. If privacy is only instrumentally valuable— meaning valuable to the extent that it brings about other valuable things for society—  then its worth can be outweighed by other social goals. It’s also possible that our right to privacy doesn’t even exist in the way we think it does. Judith Jarvis Thomson argues that our so-called right to privacy is really just a combination of other, more specific rights, like the right to own property or to use our bodies as we see fit. By this logic, all debates over privacy should be refocused on the rights which are actually being compromised. So is the safety afforded by this new system worth the cost to individual privacy? What will you do with your vote?"
553120,neeraj_aggarwal_k_pop_cutting_edge_tech_and_other_ways_asia_is_shaping_the_world,Neeraj Aggarwal,"K-pop, cutting-edge tech and other ways Asia is shaping the world",https://www.ted.com/talks/neeraj_aggarwal_k_pop_cutting_edge_tech_and_other_ways_asia_is_shaping_the_world,"Our global culture has a fascinating new look to it, and it has to do with this guy, Indian actor and musician Diljit Dosanjh. Diljit&apos;s star has risen big time of late. He performed at Coachella last year. He had incredible energy and had the audience in a foot-tapping, head-banging spell. He had the audience in North America, where he toured this year, had the same experience and performed in large, packed arenas. You know what is even more noteworthy? Diljit does not perform in English. He performs entirely in Punjabi. Diljit&apos;s momentous rise is an indicator of something fundamental happening in the world around us. The West for long has set the cultural and intellectual agenda for the world. But now, East is coming to the limelight as well. Asia today claims a cultural and intellectual authority all of its own. Yes, Diljit is popular, but even more than that, he takes pride in his own identity and is not reduced to a stereotype. He wears traditional Punjabi garb. Imagine an Indian pop star in the West dressed in a turban and a kurta. My name is Neeraj Aggarwal and yes, I&apos;m a slightly lesser known Indian than Diljit. (Laughter) With BCG, over the last 25 years, I have worked on tough problems across industries and have spent time thinking about big-picture trends. In my current role of leading BCG’s Asia Pacific region, I travel extensively, and I meet a wide range of Asians across business, government and civil society. Drawing on these experiences, I want to share with you how Asia is changing in ways you may not have imagined, and what that could mean for all of us. In the 20th century, most Americans got a taste of Asian culture, but just a taste. If you went to a local mall, the taste may be quite literally Panda Express. (Laughter) Asian cultures were somewhat exotic, somewhat stereotyped, but never had the full context. Today, the scenario is vastly different. Recently, Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh won the Oscar for the Best Actress. First Asian ever. Korean production &quot;Squid Game&quot; became Netflix&apos;s most popular show ever. In the US, now there are 400 cricket leagues, and more than 200,000 kids pick up a bat. So you may ask me, what is driving Asia&apos;s rising cultural and intellectual expansion? It has to do with Asia&apos;s rising economic power. There have been massive changes in the income pyramid. By 2030, Asia is expected to have five times as many high-income households as it had in 2000. An absolute number higher than the number in the West. Walk the streets of Mumbai, Jakarta or Shanghai. You can feel it. It&apos;s everywhere. Millions of low-income households, they’re almost all digital natives. And they want more convenience and better quality of life. No wonder Asian businesses strive to be more innovative. Asia, of course, is incredibly diverse and cannot be reduced to a chart like this. I would argue the same diversity makes this change even more profound and prolific. I started by talking about pop culture, but Asia&apos;s cultural and intellectual influence extends to ideas and business innovation. For long, we’ve equated Asian workers with outsourcing and factories. Today, however, many Asians are intellectual leaders. They&apos;re bypassing jobs with Western multinationals to start new ventures. That&apos;s a big shift. Many kids who come to West to study are keen to go back because they spot opportunities in their own countries. And this is disrupting industries. Take fintech. Twenty years ago, fintech was almost entirely a North American play, hardly visible in Asia. And living in India, it used to seem like a travesty to me. Why? Because back then, only a third of the Indians had bank accounts, and many others used to pay outrageous sums of money to moneylenders to live a basic life. It changed with the mass adoption of cell phones. Today, India&apos;s payment system UPI does about one trillion dollars-plus of transactions. When I go to a local streetside vegetable vendor, he says, &quot;Please do UPI.&quot; The same change exists in Indonesia, Philippines or Singapore. Alipay in China does 100 times more transactions than PayPal. Fintech in Asia is innovative, it&apos;s deeply entrenched and is not done growing. By 2030, I expect fintech revenues in Asia will be larger than any other part of the world. I could give you any number of such examples across industries. Instead, I want to step back and talk about the broader intellectual contributions that Asians are making. As a consultant, I deeply believe in the power of three. So I&apos;m going to give you three of them. (Laughter) First, Asian companies are investing on developing at-scale solutions with different but attractive unit economics. Take climate. Asia has more polluted cities than any other part of the world, and it&apos;s roughly half the planet&apos;s carbon footprint. Driven by adversity, many Asian companies are investing at scale in solar production and battery storage. In this case, China in particular has invested massively, and in the last two decades brought down the cost of solar panels by 95 percent. Battery storage costs are also declining. Combined, that is resulting in a huge decline in the cost of accessing solar power. The sun is coming down, but in a good way. And when I talk to the CEOs of these companies, they smile and say, “Neeraj, we are far from done.” &quot;Far from done&quot; is really encouraging because if these trends play out, solar power could muscle aside fossil fuels as a source of energy. By 2030, Asia will have twice the amount of solar deployment as the West. And thanks to Asian innovation, large parts of the world could have low-cost renewable power whenever they like. And a new panda may enter our lexicon. The solar panda. (Laughter) Asia&apos;s second intellectual contribution has to do about solutions rooted in collective good. Young Asians maintain close ties with their families throughout their lives. For them, the group is as important as they are. The same ethos permeates in businesses, so family-run enterprises and state enterprises dominate. Today, when many Western companies talk about social purpose and multi-stakeholder orientation, remember, Asia embodies that. Actually, Asia pioneered that. The region also continues to raise the bar on social consciousness. A good example is Ibasho centers, which encourage the elderly to stay involved in their communities. Originating in Japan, these centers are now traveling across Asia. An Asian CEO I know well put it this way: &quot;If I had to put a person on Mars in five years, I&apos;d look to the West. To make sure the same person survives on Mars, I&apos;d look to the East.&quot; Which brings me to the third intellectual contribution that Asians are making, which is driven by their own unique challenges and what I call a “leapfrog mindset.” Take health care. Asia is 60 percent of the world&apos;s population and more than half of the burden of diseases like diabetes, cancer. Asian countries, shown in green dots here, cannot replicate the path taken by the Western nations, as that path is prohibitively expensive and is not always guaranteed to get you the best outcomes. So instead of the red arrow path, they need to leapfrog and take an alternative white arrow path. Health care that is less costly and gets you to a better outcome and accomplishes more. Digital technology today offers exciting possibilities. Interoperable health records is one way of addressing this challenge, because they allow continuity of care from a small doctor&apos;s clinic to a big hospital. Many countries have stumbled to implement this, but India in this case has taken a big leap forward and digitized 400 million health records. Of course, a lot more needs to be done. The Asian private sector is getting into the mix as well. My daughter who&apos;s sitting here recently interned at a start-up which does low-cost portable diagnostics for diseases like diabetes and respiratory infections. In Asian healthcare, I feel the same kind of energy that propelled fintech to where it is today. And I find that extremely promising. Asia&apos;s intellectual contributions can be summed up, in my mind, as a new kind of URL. We have unit economics rooted in collective good and a leapfrog mindset. As you may have guessed, consultants love acronyms too. (Laughter) So what does Asia&apos;s rising cultural and intellectual influence mean for the world? In the short term, it may mean some disruption, but in the long term, it will mean progress for everyone. As Asian culture moves westward, and as Asian ideas and business innovation take root, our lives will be more diverse, more interesting, and frankly, more fun. Our societies will be more resilient. As we deal with climate change or potentially a next pandemic, we will have two different paradigms to work with and not just one. So let&apos;s embrace Asia&apos;s new place in the world. Let&apos;s celebrate our interdependence and the richness it brings us. Let&apos;s look to Asia as a place for learning, growth, progress and excitement. Let&apos;s enjoy our Taylor Swift and our Diljit Dosanjh, too. Thank you. (Applause)"
548273,sam_kass_a_menu_of_foods_we_might_lose_forever,Sam Kass,A menu of foods we might lose forever,https://www.ted.com/talks/sam_kass_a_menu_of_foods_we_might_lose_forever,"Hello, everybody. I am here to welcome you to the Last Supper. This menu has been put together with ingredients that experts and models predict will not be around for our kids and our grandkids. And you&apos;ll see that it&apos;s many of the foods that we that we hold dear. Now I started off my career as a chef and then into policy and now working on technology and innovation, trying to build some of the solutions for the future. I first came up with this menu idea in 2015, around COP21 in Paris. And the point of this menu is not to depress you. (Laughter) It&apos;s not to, you know, make you feel bad. It&apos;s to really talk about what&apos;s at stake when we say the words climate change. What do the words climate change actually mean? What does two degrees&apos; warming actually mean? I&apos;m from Chicago, like, two degrees&apos; warming, that sounds good. I&apos;m like, &quot;Let&apos;s warm it up a little bit, what about five?&quot; And I think we&apos;ve really failed to connect what&apos;s truly at stake when we talk about the issues that we&apos;ve been discussing today. So let&apos;s get into it. Let&apos;s start with the hors d&apos;oeuvres, those appetizers. Let&apos;s turn to fruit. Turns out that trees are really having a tough time. And this includes nuts and stone fruit, like pistachios and almonds or peaches. Last year, we lost 95 percent of the Georgia peach crop. 95 percent. And when you start to look at the models, and how our environment is changing in our lifetimes, I don&apos;t believe we&apos;ll be growing peaches in Georgia at all. Let&apos;s talk about the wheat in your bread or the rice in your salad, or the chickpeas in one of the dishes -- some of the core commodities, the core staples that feed the world. But in the United States, the models show that about for every one degree of warming, we&apos;ll lose about 7.5 percent yield. We&apos;ll decline about 7.5 percent, year over year. That&apos;s only part of the story. The other challenge is right now, on a global basis, 15 percent of the world&apos;s wheat is produced in persistent drought conditions. But if and when we hit that two degrees, 60 percent will be produced in persistent drought conditions. So not only are we going to see a precipitous decline of yields over time, we&apos;re going to see much more frequent disruptions and complete collapses of harvest in certain regions. It is impossible to comprehend the economic upheaval as we start to see these core commodities decline, the food insecurity and malnutrition that will result of this, and the political instability of forced migration and conflict over resource as these core foods that feed most of the world start to decline because of climate. So let&apos;s go to your main course, let&apos;s go to salmon. Salmon are also having a really tough time. We all know their epic journeys up rivers to spawn. And those rivers are not only warming but we&apos;re starting to see reduced flows into them because of reduced snowpack. And by about 2050, the models show that we will lose about half of that flow into those rivers because of reduced snowpack, making that journey for those fry back to the ocean nearly impossible. But there&apos;s also massive heat waves that are flowing through our oceans now. Those heat waves lower the oxygen levels and make the environment really unsuitable for many of these life-forms. This past year, just a few weeks ago, California announced it had closed the entire commercial fishing for the whole state, the whole coast, because, essentially, there weren&apos;t any fish to fish. This is not some far-out future challenge. Now I wish I could tell you, you know, you&apos;re still going to have your dessert and everything is fine, but I&apos;m sorry, I have to come for your chocolate, too. And in some ways, chocolate is faring the worst. You&apos;ve probably never had a bite of chocolate that wasn&apos;t grown within about 10 degrees of the equator by smallholder farmers. And there is not a single model that shows that, if and when we hit two degrees, that any of that region will be suitable for chocolate production. It will be too dry and too hot. That means those trees are going to have to walk and move. They&apos;re not very good at that. And the communities that that will affect are ones that do not have the resources to weather storms of that nature. The economic and social upheaval that will come from those kind of changes is profound. And again, this year, not in 2040 or 2050, chocolate prices are up by 50 percent, because those production ecosystems have been hammered by drought and extreme weather. 50 percent, this year. I’m going to give you one more. And this is where, like, I just don&apos;t even know what to do. I&apos;m ready to do anything to solve the problem. Raise your hand if you’ve had a cup of coffee today or a cup of tea. Oh, yeah. I&apos;m sorry, I know. Let&apos;s say, how many of you had two cups? Three? Yeah, four? Alright, guys, we should talk, because I&apos;m a little worried about you. (Laughter) Even for me, and I&apos;m a real coffee person, that&apos;s a little extreme. I&apos;m not going to ask five, because then -- Yeah, exactly. I could see it in your face, sir. (Laughs) So, yeah, coffee too. The IDB predicts that, just similar to wine, if and when we hit two degrees, about half of the regions that are currently growing coffee will no longer be suitable for coffee production. About 75 of the 124 wild varieties of coffee are on the verge of extinction right now, and that&apos;s really a problem, because much of the genetic material that we will need to try to produce hybrid varieties that could thrive in much more volatile climate are going to be lost. But the point here is not to depress you or to scare you, it&apos;s not. No, it&apos;s not. It&apos;s to try to make an emotional connection in a way that only food can, to understand really what&apos;s at stake when we&apos;re having these conversations. And I believe what&apos;s at stake is, fundamentally, our way of life on planet Earth. It&apos;s our identities, both as individuals and as communities and cultures. It’s the vibrancy of our country and of the world. And fundamentally, as a father of two young boys aged six and five, Cy and Rafa, it is fundamentally our ability to pass to the next generation a better life than we were given, a life that is as rich and delicious as the one we&apos;ve been lucky enough to have. That is truly at stake now. The good news is, on our plates really does hold some of the biggest both problems but also potential to solve these challenges of anywhere that we have. And that&apos;s the part that gives me a ton of hope. We know food is a giant driver of environmental and climate-change damage. It&apos;s the number-one driver of biodiversity loss, by a lot, number-one driver of deforestation and land-use change, number-one use of the world&apos;s dwindling freshwater. 70 percent of our water goes into how we feed ourselves. And it&apos;s the number-two driver of greenhouse-gas emissions, globally. Now unlike energy and mobility and transportation, where we can see a future where that curve is going to bend, food and agriculture is going straight up, with absolutely no end in sight. So we must figure out how to reduce the negative impacts the system is having on our planet. Full stop. The second big part of the work that we collectively have to do is around adaptation and resilience, a part that we are simply entirely unprepared to deal with right now. We are now about to enter an age of extreme volatility, with dwindling resources of water and soil, higher energy prices. And we essentially are unprepared. So we need much more investment and focus on preparing a food system to deal with the reality that we are entering in today. But this third part is the part that gets me excited and gives me a lot of hope. Because I firmly believe, I know it to be true, that food and agriculture, nature-based solutions more broadly -- namely, you throw in there oceans and forestry -- are the only systems on planet Earth that has the capacity to sequester enough carbon in the time horizon -- this is the important part -- 110 billion metric tons of carbon that are in our atmosphere used to be in our soils. That&apos;s 80 years of our current footprint. And we are starting to see tools and technologies and rediscovering old techniques that can take a lot of that carbon and put it back into the soil. And technologies that allow our food system to become much more efficient and vibrant. I&apos;ll give you a couple that are superexciting to me. One is a company called Loam Bio that has discovered fungi microbes that coat seeds, that are pulling between one and three tonnes of carbon per acre per year, and store that carbon in more permanent forms in the soil. When you do the math on how many acres are under cultivation, this is a tool that can be transformational. Or a company like Inari Agriculture, using modern breeding techniques that can dramatically increase yield while reducing the amount of fertilizer that’s needed or pesticides and herbicides that are needed to protect that plant. I could go on and on about these tools. They&apos;re out there. We have the solutions at hand. The problem is we&apos;re just out of time. So for all of us who are working on these issues, or leading in whatever we are doing, if we have our plan and we feel comfortable, like, &quot;This feels about right, I&apos;m doing my thing,&quot; then we&apos;re simply not doing enough. We have to get fundamentally out of our comfort zone and take on a lot more risk in terms of our actions. So I hope that, as we sit here tonight together and eat some of the challenges we face, we understand what&apos;s truly at stake. We understand that we absolutely have the capacity to solve this challenge, but that if we don&apos;t act now, we&apos;re going to lose time. But I know that we can look back, and collectively say to ourselves, &quot;We stood up and met the moment, and we ensured that our kids and that our grandkids will be able to enjoy a delicious meal like the one we’re having here tonight.” So thank you for your work, and I look forward to seeing what we can do together."
553107,jennifer_golbeck_is_ai_progress_stuck,Jennifer Golbeck,Is AI progress stuck?,https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_golbeck_is_ai_progress_stuck,"We&apos;ve built artificial intelligence already that, on specific tasks, performs better than humans. There&apos;s AI that can play chess and beat human grandmasters. But since the introduction of generative AI to the general public a couple years ago, there&apos;s been more talk about artificial general intelligence, or AGI, and that describes the idea that there&apos;s AI that can perform at or above human levels on a wide variety of tasks, just like we humans are able to do. And people who think about AGI are worried about what it means if we reach that level of performance in the technology. Right now, there&apos;s people from the tech industry coming out and saying &quot;The AI that we&apos;re building is so powerful and dangerous that it poses a threat to civilization.” And they’re going to government and saying, &quot;Maybe you need to regulate us.&quot; Now normally when an industry makes a powerful new tool, they don&apos;t say it poses an existential threat to humanity and that it needs to be limited, so why are we hearing that language? And I think there&apos;s two main reasons. One is if your technology is so powerful that it can destroy civilization, between now and then, there&apos;s an awful lot of money to be made with that. And what better way to convince your investors to put some money with you than to warn that your tool is that dangerous? The other is that the idea of AI overtaking humanity is truly a cinematic concept. We’ve all seen those movies. And it’s kind of entertaining to think about what that would mean now with tools that we&apos;re actually able to put our hands on. In fact, it’s so entertaining that it’s a very effective distraction from the real problems already happening in the world because of AI. The more we think about these improbable futures, the less time we spend thinking about how do we correct deepfakes or the fact that there&apos;s AI right now being used to decide whether or not people are let out of prison, and we know it’s racially biased. But are we anywhere close to actually achieving AGI? Some people think so. Elon Musk said that we&apos;ll achieve it within a year. I think he posted this a few weeks ago. But like at the same time Google put out their eye search tool that&apos;s supposed to give you the answer so you don’t have to click on a link, and it&apos;s not going super well. [&quot;How many rocks should I eat?&quot;] [&quot;... at least a single serving of pebbles, geodes or gravel ...&quot;] Please don&apos;t eat rocks. (Laughter) Now of course these tools are going to get better. But if we&apos;re going to achieve AGI or if they&apos;re even going to fundamentally change the way we work, we need to be in a place where they are continuing on a sharp upward trajectory in terms of their abilities. And that may be one path. But there&apos;s also the possibility that what we&apos;re seeing is that these tools have basically achieved what they&apos;re capable of doing, and the future is incremental improvements in a plateau. So to understand the AI future, we need to look at all the hype around it and get under there and see what&apos;s technically possible. And we also need to think about where are the areas that we need to worry and where are the areas that we don&apos;t. So if we want to realize the hype around AI, the one main challenge that we have to solve is reliability. These algorithms are wrong all the time, like we saw with Google. And Google actually came out and said, after these bad search results were popularized, that they don&apos;t know how to fix this problem. I use ChatGPT every day. I write a newsletter that summarizes discussions on far-right message boards, and so I download that data, ChatGPT helps me write a summary. And it makes me much more efficient than if I had to do it by hand. But I have to correct it every day because it misunderstands something, it takes out the context. And so because of that, I can&apos;t just rely on it to do the job for me. And this reliability is really important. Now a subpart of reliability in this space is AI hallucination, a great technical term for the fact that AI just makes stuff up a lot of the time. I did this in my newsletter. I said, ChatGPT are there any people threatening violence? If so, give me the quotes. And it produced these three really clear threats of violence that didn&apos;t sound anything like people talk on these message boards. And I went back to the data, and nobody ever said it. It just made it up out of thin air. And you may have seen this if you&apos;ve used an AI image generator. I asked it to give me a close up of people holding hands. That&apos;s a hallucination and a disturbing one at that. (Laughter) We have to solve this hallucination problem if this AI is going to live up to the hype. And I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a solvable problem. With the way this technology works, there are people who say, we&apos;re going to have it taken care of in a few months, but there’s no technical reason to think that’s the case. Because generative AI always makes stuff up. When you ask it a question, it&apos;s creating that answer or creating that image from scratch when you ask. It&apos;s not like a search engine that goes and finds the right answer on a page. And so because its job is to make things up every time, I don&apos;t know that we&apos;re going to be able to get it to make up correct stuff and then not make up other stuff. That&apos;s not what it&apos;s trained to do, and we&apos;re very far from achieving that. And in fact, there are spaces where they&apos;re trying really hard. One space that there&apos;s a lot of enthusiasm for AI is in the legal area where they hope it will help write legal briefs or do research. Some people have found out the hard way that they should not write legal briefs right now with ChatGPT and send them to federal court, because it just makes up cases that sound right. And that&apos;s a really fast way to get a judge mad at you and to get your case thrown out. Now there are legal research companies right now that advertise hallucination-free generative AI. And I was really dubious about this. And researchers at Stanford actually went in and checked it, and they found the best-performing of these hallucination-free tools still hallucinates 17 percent of the time. So like on one hand, it&apos;s a great scientific achievement that we have built a tool that we can pose basically any query to, and 60 or 70 or maybe even 80 percent of the time it gives us a reasonable answer. But if we&apos;re going to rely on using those tools and they&apos;re wrong 20 or 30 percent of the time, there&apos;s no model where that&apos;s really useful. And that kind of leads us into how do we make these tools that useful? Because even if you don&apos;t believe me and think we&apos;re going to solve this hallucination problem, we&apos;re going to solve the reliability problem, the tools still need to get better than they are now. And there&apos;s two things they need to do that. One is lots more data and two is the technology itself has to improve. So where are we going to get that data? Because they&apos;ve kind of taken all the reliable stuff online already. And if we were to find twice as much data as they&apos;ve already had, that doesn&apos;t mean they&apos;re going to be twice as smart. I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s enough data out there, and it&apos;s compounded by the fact that one way the generative AI has been very successful is at producing low-quality content online. That&apos;s bots on social media, misinformation, and these SEO pages that don&apos;t really say anything but have a lot of ads and come up high in the search results. And if the AI starts training on pages that it generated, we know from decades of AI research that they just get progressively worse. It&apos;s like the digital version of mad cow disease. (Laughter) Let&apos;s say we solve the data problem. You still have to get the technology better. And we&apos;ve seen 50 billion dollars in the last couple years invested in improving generative AI. And that&apos;s resulted in three billion dollars in revenue. So that&apos;s not sustainable. But of course it&apos;s early, right? Companies may find ways to start using this technology. But is it going to be valuable enough to justify the tens and maybe hundreds of billions of dollars of hardware that needs to be bought to make these models get better? I don&apos;t think so. And we can kind of start looking at practical examples to figure that out. And it leads us to think about where are the spaces we need to worry and not. Because one place that everybody&apos;s worried with this is that AI is going to take all of our jobs. Lots of people are telling us that’s going to happen, and people are worried about it. And I think there&apos;s a fundamental misunderstanding at the heart of that. So imagine this scenario. We have a company, and they can afford to employ two software engineers. And if we were to give those engineers some generative AI to help write code, which is something it&apos;s pretty good at, let&apos;s say they&apos;re twice as efficient. That&apos;s a big overestimate, but it makes the math easy. So in that case, the company has two choices. They could fire one of those software engineers because the other one can do the work of two people now, or they already could afford two of them, and now they&apos;re twice as efficient, so they&apos;re bringing in more money. So why not keep both of them and take that extra profit? The only way this math fails is if the AI is so expensive that it&apos;s not worth it. But that would be like the AI is 100,000 dollars a year to do one person&apos;s worth of work. So that sounds really expensive. And practically, there are already open-source versions of these tools that are low-cost, that companies can install and run themselves. Now they don’t perform as well as the flagship models, but if they&apos;re half as good and really cheap, wouldn&apos;t you take those over the one that costs 100,000 dollars a year to do one person&apos;s work? Of course you would. And so even if we solve reliability, we solve the data problem, we make the models better, the fact that there are cheap versions of this available suggests that companies aren&apos;t going to be spending hundreds of millions of dollars to replace their workforce with AI. There are areas that we need to worry, though. Because if we look at AI now, there are lots of problems that we haven&apos;t been able to solve. I&apos;ve been building artificial intelligence for over 20 years, and one thing we know is that if we train AI on human data, the AI adopts human biases, and we have not been able to fix that. We&apos;ve seen those biases start showing up in generative AI, and the gut reaction is always, well, let&apos;s just put in some guardrails to stop the AI from doing the biased thing. But one, that never fixes the bias because the AI finds a way around it. And two, the guardrails themselves can cause problems. So Google has an AI image generator, and they tried to put guardrails in place to stop the bias in the results. And it turned out it made it wrong. This is a request for a picture of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. And it&apos;s a great picture, but it is not factually correct. And so in trying to stop the bias, we end up creating more reliability problems. We haven&apos;t been able to solve this problem of bias. And if we&apos;re thinking about deferring decision making, replacing human decision makers and relying on this technology and we can&apos;t solve this problem, that&apos;s a thing that we should worry about and demand solutions to before it&apos;s just widely adopted and employed because it&apos;s sexy. And I think there&apos;s one final thing that&apos;s missing here, which is our human intelligence is not defined by our productivity at work. At its core, it&apos;s defined by our ability to connect with other people. Our ability to have emotional responses, to take our past and integrate it with new information and creatively come up with new things. And that’s something that artificial intelligence is not now nor will it ever be capable of doing. It may be able to imitate it and give us a cheap facsimile of genuine connection and empathy and creativity. But it can&apos;t do those core things to our humanity. And that&apos;s why I&apos;m not really worried about AGI taking over civilization. But if you come away from this disbelieving everything I have told you, and right now you&apos;re worried about humanity being destroyed by AI overlords, the one thing to remember is, despite what the movies have told you, if it gets really bad, we still can always just turn it off. (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause)"
548462,umit_kurt_ugly_history_the_armenian_genocide,Ümit Kurt,Ugly History: The Armenian Genocide,https://www.ted.com/talks/umit_kurt_ugly_history_the_armenian_genocide,"In the 19th century,  Christian Armenians in the Ottoman Empire lived as second-class citizens. They were taxed disproportionately, forbidden from giving testimony in Ottoman courts, and frequently attacked by local Kurdish tribes. In 1878, Armenian activists negotiated a treaty to enact reforms, but Sultan Abdul Hamid II refused to make good on these promises. And when an Armenian resistance movement began to form, the sultan took decisive action. From 1894 to 1896, he led the Hamidian Massacres— a relentless campaign of violence that took the lives of over 150,000 Armenians. These massacres were the culmination of centuries of Armenian oppression. Yet they were only the beginning of an even greater tragedy— a genocide hidden under the guise of World War I that would include the deportation, forced Islamization,  and mass murder of nearly 1 million Armenians. As some of the most ancient inhabitants of this region, the Armenian people were originally a collective of tribes living in the mountains of Western Asia. By the 6th century BCE, these tribes were living in one nation  called Armenia, which, over the following 2,000 years, was controlled by various local and invading leaders. But whoever ruled their homeland, a devotion to Christianity became  a vital part of their ethnic identity, even as their neighbors increasingly adopted Islam. In what’s currently eastern Turkey, Christian Armenians shared the area with Muslim Kurds for centuries, until Turkic-speaking peoples invaded the region. Four centuries later, Ottoman Turks claimed these communities as part of the vast Ottoman Empire. While the empire’s systematic preference towards Muslims made life difficult  for Armenians, Greeks, and Jews, by the late 19th century, well-educated Armenian elites were able to attain prominent positions in banking, commerce, and government. However, this rise in influence became a source of resentment, and many Muslim Ottomans believed Armenians would eventually betray the empire to form their own independent state. This belief is partly what led Abdul Hamid to begin the Hamidian Massacres. Thankfully, the Ottoman Armenians fighting the sultan’s forces weren’t alone. Armenians from neighboring Russia had recently founded two resistance organizations which offered a haven for refugees and supplied arms to villages under siege. Finally, in April 1909, the sultan was deposed following the Young Turk Revolution. But despite initial promises, this new government also failed to pass meaningful reforms. A second wave of massacres ravaged the Armenian population, and the era of international warfare to come would only make things worse. During the First Balkan War, thousands of Muslim refugees were sent to the Armenian stronghold of Anatolia, further increasing tensions between Christian and Muslim Ottomans. And in the first winter of World War I, Ottoman general Enver Pasha attempted to flank opposing Russian forces by sending his troops through the frigid Sarıkamış mountains. When their unit froze to death. Enver Pasha blamed the disaster on “Armenian treachery,” and ordered the immediate disarming of all non-Muslims— a decision which moved many Armenians from the front lines of an external war to the trenches of an internal one. By 1915, the Ottomans were enacting more violence on their own Armenian citizens than any foreign enemy. At this time, Turkish nationalist Talaat Pasha  had become the de facto leader of the Ottoman Empire, and he ordered the deportation of all Armenians in eastern Anatolia on the grounds of national security. Talaat’s new legislation allowed Armenian property and businesses to be seized as wartime necessities, and able-bodied Armenian men were routinely killed to lower the likelihood of resistance. Most Armenians were marched to concentration camps in the Syrian desert, where they regularly suffered robbery, abduction, and rape. The few women and children who escaped deportation were forcibly converted to Islam. The ruling Turks saw Muslim identity as the cornerstone of their vision for the empire, so escaped Armenian youths were placed in orphanages to indoctrinate them with Muslim culture and traditions. Children who resisted were subjected to violence and torture. When the majority of these killings ended in 1916, it was estimated that the population of Ottoman Armenians had dropped from 1.5 million to roughly 500,000. In the decades that followed, many of the remaining Armenians dispersed across the globe. Families who immigrated to eastern Russia may have eventually been incorporated into the modern nation of Armenia, which received its independence in 1991. But to this day the Turkish government denies this genocide occurred. Official government language acknowledges the violence but defines the Ottoman’s actions as “necessary measures,” and Armenian deaths as unfortunate consequences of war. In recent years, some Turkish historians have refuted this stance and begun writing about this period with less fear of retribution. In the pursuit of justice, many Armenians and Armenian-led non-profit organizations work tirelessly to advocate for the recognition of this genocide, and accountability for those responsible."
552751,rhaina_cohen_why_friendship_can_be_just_as_meaningful_as_romantic_love,Rhaina Cohen,Why friendship can be just as meaningful as romantic love,https://www.ted.com/talks/rhaina_cohen_why_friendship_can_be_just_as_meaningful_as_romantic_love,"There is a Supreme Court case that you could mistake for a sermon. It&apos;s the case that recognized that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. Here is a sense of what Justice Kennedy wrote: “Marriage responds to the universal fear that a lonely person might call out only to find no one there.&quot; He goes on to say that marriage offers care and companionship, and the decision argues that these are basic human needs that everyone should have access to, whether they&apos;re straight or queer. Validating. But what do these words say to you if you&apos;re single? Anybody single here? I mean, there should be quite a few of you, because in the US, the percentage of American adults who have never been married is at a record high. Married people, you&apos;re not off the hook. I’m going to get a little morbid for a moment and have you contemplate what happens if your marriage doesn&apos;t last until the end of your life, whether because of divorce or outliving your spouse? In the US, about 30 percent of women over 65 are widows. The reality is, any one of us is unlikely to have a spouse by our side until our last dying breath. Regardless of whether we are partnered now, we need to rely on more than one relationship to sustain us throughout our full, unpredictable lives. We need other significant others. And there&apos;s an overlooked kind of relationship that we can turn to. Friendship. I got the sense that friendship could be this stronger force in our lives because of a friendship that I stumbled into. We would see each other most days of the week, be each other’s plus-ones to parties. My friend has this habit of grabbing my hand to hold, including when I brought her to my office, and then I&apos;d have to be like, no, not in the office. (Laughter) But I mean, I wouldn&apos;t let my husband do that in the office either. It&apos;s just, you know, setting matters. But it was only an issue because for us, affection is a reflex. And I knew it couldn&apos;t be just us. I went out and interviewed dozens of people who had a friendship like ours, and I wrote a book about them. And the kinds of friends that I spoke to, they don&apos;t just have a weekly phone call. They&apos;re friends like these. Natasha and Linda are the first legally recognized platonic co-parents in Canada. And this is them with their teenage son on vacation. Joe and John have been best friends for many decades. When Joe was struggling with alcohol and drug use, John got him into recovery. And then John decided that to support his friend, he would also become sober. Joy took care of her friend Hannah during Hannah&apos;s six-year battle with ovarian cancer. And that included flying out to New York, where Hannah got specialized treatment. Joy had trouble actually sleeping overnight in the hospital, because she was too busy watching to make sure her friend&apos;s chest was still rising and falling. Some of the friends that I spoke to had this friendship occupy the space that&apos;s conventionally given to a romantic partner. Some had this kind of friendship and a romantic partner. It’s not either/or. As I spoke to these people, I realized that they were at the frontier of friendship, helping us imagine how much more we could ask of our platonic relationships. Which is true, but another way of looking at it is they&apos;re doing something retro, even ancient. In ancient Rome, friends would talk about each other as &quot;half of my soul,&quot; or &quot;the greater part of my soul.&quot; The kind of language we now use in romantic relationships. From China to Jordan to England, there was a practice called “sworn brotherhood,” where male friends would go through a ritual that would turn them into brothers. About a century ago, friends would sit for portraits like these, with their arms wrapped around each other, their bodies up close. What I took from this history is that if we don&apos;t limit friendship, it can be central to our lives. But today, not everybody recognizes that. I spoke to a mother who really tried to get her son to make dating a priority because she wanted him to find emotional wholeness. And her son told her, &quot;I found it in my platonic life partner.&quot; His best friend, who he had known since high school, who had moved across the country to be near him, to live with him, in fact. The mother said, &quot;I don&apos;t understand how you can be partners with someone you&apos;re not romantic with.&quot; Understandable as a reaction in a culture that treats friendship as the sidekick to the real hero of romance. We get that message from rom-coms, from Supreme Court justices, also from policy. So Joy, during the six years she took care of her friend, she was not entitled to family medical leave. When Hannah died, Joy was not entitled to bereavement leave, because the two of them were considered unrelated. In our government and workplace policies, friendship is invisible. Sometimes this diminishment of friendship comes from the outside, and sometimes it comes from the inside. A woman wrote to me about her friend who she considers her person. She spent so much time with her friend&apos;s kids that she was given car seats for them. She&apos;s also divorced and tried to find a new spouse because there was a hole she wanted to fill in her life. Then she read stories of people like Joe and John in an article I&apos;d written. And she realized there was no hole. She had been happy all along, but she hadn&apos;t known, been made to believe that it was possible to have a friend be enough. If we can recognize what friendship has the potential to be, and if we can recognize that there is more than one kind of significant other then we can imagine more ways for us to find love and care and companionship. And we can support people who have these kinds of friendships. So the mother I mentioned, she&apos;s completely changed her tune. She now admires the commitment between her son and her son&apos;s friend. I feel like I get to live in a future world where you can just build a life with your friends. I live not only with my husband but also two of my closest friends. One of them we kind of like had a courtship process to recruit him to come to our city and live with us. The other had a job in our city, and we invited her to stay. It didn&apos;t take long for us to start scheming with about a half dozen other friends, about trying to buy property together. The kind of place where we could raise kids alongside one another, our working title for the place is “The Village.” I don&apos;t know if this will work out. I can keep you posted about it, but if it does, I feel really confident about one thing. That if one of us has a migraine at 6am and there&apos;s a toddler bouncing around, or we get a terrifying diagnosis, we will not be a lonely person calling out only for no one to answer. And this is what I hope for all of us. That we feel like we have permission to share our lives with whoever we are lucky enough to find, whether that&apos;s a spouse, a sibling or a house full of friends. Thank you. (Applause)"
547177,karthik_muralidharan_why_spending_smarter_beats_bigger_budgets,Karthik Muralidharan,Why spending smarter beats bigger budgets,https://www.ted.com/talks/karthik_muralidharan_why_spending_smarter_beats_bigger_budgets,"So the good news on global development is that key indicators, like child mortality and school enrollment, are better today than at any point in human history. However, the bad news is that though many more children are surviving, large numbers are not thriving. As of 2022, we had nearly 150 million stunted children, or around 22 percent of the world&apos;s children. Similarly, 70 percent of children aged 10 in low- and middle-income countries could not read a simple passage. Put together, the world is behind schedule on over 85 percent of the United Nations&apos; Sustainable Development Goals. Now, at one level, this might seem very bleak, but I&apos;m here today to tell you that I&apos;m optimistic that we can accelerate global development, because there is a free lunch. OK, now you may be thinking, &quot;Is this guy really an economist?&quot; You know, we&apos;re taught that the first, basic lesson of economics is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. But I am a professor of economics, and I am going to show you a free lunch today. And the source of this free lunch comes from the fact that over the past two decades, the explosion in the availability of data, computing power and better research methods, including the growing use of randomized controlled trials in social policy, has helped us identify large sets of interventions that have a 10x return on investment that we’re not acting on. At the same time, the research has also identified that governments around the world spend billions of dollars on interventions that are pretty ineffective. And so the free lunch is pretty simple, that we can deliver a lot more for global development, not necessarily by spending more, but by spending smarter, which basically means spending less on things that are less effective and more on underfunded ideas that could be transformative. So let&apos;s explore this with a deep dive into global education. As with all other areas, the good news is that school enrollment is higher today than it ever had been before. The bad news is that this increase in enrollment has not translated into learning outcomes. So with 70 percent of 10-year-olds in low- and middle-income countries not able to read a simple passage, we have a global learning crisis. This is both a moral tragedy for the individual children whose lifelong capabilities and opportunities are constrained by weak education, but it&apos;s also a tragedy for their countries, because it limits long-term productivity and economic growth. Now, the normal approach to dealing with this problem is to say we need to spend more, either through more foreign aid or through higher government budgets. But what the research also shows is that most of the business-as-usual spending that we do is not very effective. In particular, we have studies showing that upgrading school infrastructure, hiring more credentialed teachers, increasing teacher pay, or even giving students free textbooks and laptops don&apos;t seem to be having much of an impact. So the question is, what is going on? How do you make sense of this? Now, one problem is a problem of governance and accountability, which limits the translation of public expenditure into outcomes. But a bigger problem may be weaknesses in pedagogy and teaching within the classroom, as seen in this figure. Now this figure comes from one of my studies in India, with a sample of over 6,000 kids, and I consider it to be perhaps the most important figure for understanding education in low- and middle-income countries. The x-axis here is the grade in which the student is enrolled. The y-axis is the level of learning. Now if students were making progress as per the rate of the curriculum, they should be on that 45-degree red line. In practice, kids fall behind quickly, for a variety of reasons, and stay behind. And the true rate of progress is around half of what is in the curriculum, as seen by the blue line. So what that means is your average eighth-grade kid in public school in India has about a fourth-grade level of understanding of mathematics. Now, further, with dynamic computer adaptive testing, we can pinpoint the exact learning level of every student in the sample. And so every circle here represents about 10 kids. And what you see now is if you focus on the  eighth-grade part of that picture, is that in one eighth-grade classroom, you have students at a second-grade level, at a third, at a fourth, at a fifth, all the way up to an eighth-grade level of understanding. That means that this teacher has a nearly humanly impossible task of catering to that kind of variation in the classroom. And so what does the teacher do? Even a sincere, motivated teacher will focus on completing the curriculum and the textbook. But the problem is that does not translate into much learning, because it is so far ahead of the level of where the kids are. (Speaks in Hindi) (Cheers and applause) Now, what have I just done to you? (Laughter and applause) I have given you 25 seconds in the shoes of a typical kid in a typical classroom, in millions of schools around the world. (Cheers and applause) And so what that helps you understand is I could be highly motivated, highly qualified, highly sincere, but that instruction is not going to result in learning, because it&apos;s way above your level of understanding, and it will only reach a small fraction of the kids in the class, as we saw by those who put up their hands in this room. (Laughter) And now that also helps make sense of why default things like upgrading school infrastructure, increasing teacher pay, giving free textbooks or even free laptops, often don&apos;t seem to have much of an impact. And that&apos;s because they&apos;re not addressing the binding constraint to learning, which is the mismatch between instruction and comprehension. Now, while free tablets or laptops don&apos;t seem to have much impact by themselves, we found large positive effects of customized learning software, called MindSpark, in India, that was able to tailor instruction to every kid in the class. And so now, in that same eighth-grade class, you&apos;ve got kids at completely different levels, but who are being taught at a level that&apos;s right for them. And the results were stunning. We saw among the largest gains in any education study done in developing countries, and in four months of the program, they gained about a full year of learning. OK, so that&apos;s the case to be optimistic. But this is TED. And so before we think that technology will replace the teacher, here&apos;s another tale of caution. During COVID, we ran another randomized controlled trial that gave a large number of kids free tablets with MindSpark, that we know works, and we gave it to them to use at home when schools were shut down. And unfortunately, the impact was exactly zero. And we know why, because you can track the usage, and you see that, without the adult supporting the child, there is no engagement and no learning. OK, so put together, what this tells us is that technology has the potential to be transformative, but it&apos;s not a silver bullet by itself. But if you use the data and the evidence to iterate the solution, you can use technology to transform education at scale. In other cases, completely low-tech interventions can be highly effective, such as remedial after-school tutoring programs, often run by high school graduates with no formal teacher training. In another recent study, we studied the impact of one of the world&apos;s largest COVID remediation education programs, run by the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. So in this program, the government hired about 200,000 young women with a high school degree to provide 60 to 90 minutes of remedial instruction after school. And it reached over three million students, and the program was highly effective, improved equity and was about 10 times more cost-effective than usual education spending. But that program would have been discontinued if we didn&apos;t present that study to the government leadership, because they would have thought, &quot;It&apos;s one year after COVID. We don&apos;t need this.&quot; Now, this pattern of 10x ROI investments is not restricted to education. In sector after sector, ranging from education, early childhood development, welfare programs and even justice, the research over the past decade has identified a series of 10x ROI opportunities. Now, if you’re a private-sector investor and I’m offering you a 10x ROI, you&apos;d be clamoring to put as much money to work as possible in that opportunity. But governments often don&apos;t act on these ideas, due to a combination of inertia, risk aversion and lack of political and bureaucratic incentives to act. As an economist, I don&apos;t worry about how Toyota produces its cars, because you face market prices for inputs and market prices for outputs, and if you&apos;re not efficient, there&apos;s competitive pressure to get you there. In contrast, governments can spend taxpayer money badly, and leave 100-dollar bills lying on the sidewalk for a really long time because they don&apos;t face a market test for their actions, and don&apos;t get the feedback on the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of their spending. And that&apos;s why research and evidence is especially important for guiding effective public spending, way more so than in the private sector, where you have the incentives that push you there. Now, it&apos;s going to be easy to think that governments are these big, lumbering beasts, which they are. But there is absolutely no getting away from the centrality of improving government effectiveness for global development. And that&apos;s because the problems of development are concentrated among the poor, and markets will typically not cater as much to the poor. Markets are wonderful things, and provide the incentives for the innovation and the dynamism needed to power modern economies. But markets don&apos;t care for you if you don&apos;t have purchasing power. And so the basic tension here is that the democratic ideal is one person, one vote, whereas the market values you on a one dollar, one vote principle. And that&apos;s why there&apos;s no getting away from building effective public systems to make sure that we can get the benefits of innovation to the poor at scale, who otherwise would not be able to afford them. This is how -- (Applause) This is how we managed to substantially reduce infant mortality in the 20th century. It was not enough to have new knowledge on effective medical interventions, like vaccinations or oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea. It was essential to build the public systems that could take that new knowledge and deliver that at scale, and reach the poor, who otherwise would not be able to access these benefits. So, to summarize, in a world of slowing economic growth, climate change, wars and scarring from pandemics, there&apos;s a very real risk that progress in global development slows down, or even reverses. But we have reason to be optimistic that there is a huge free lunch on the table that we can act on by using data and evidence to improve the effectiveness of public spending. But just because it&apos;s free does not mean it is easy. It is free because you can achieve a lot more by spending smarter rather than spending more. But it is not easy, because that requires us to work with governments and patiently build the public systems to improve the effectiveness of public expenditure that can reach the poor at scale. This is, increasingly, what I&apos;ve been working on, and I&apos;m incredibly encouraged by my engagements and interactions with many outstanding government officials, in India and around the world, who want to do exactly this. And that&apos;s why I&apos;m optimistic that we can sharply accelerate global development. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

Ian, of course, is the president and founder of Eurasia Group. He is the head of GZERO Media, and he is here to talk to us about what just happened in the United States. Today is November 7, the election was on November 5. President Trump was reelected in handy terms. So, Ian, please tell us what you make of what is happening right now. Ian Bremmer: You’re right, it is not just the electoral vote but also the popular vote that Trump was able to win. I mean, it&apos;s close, you know, 51-49, so half of the Americans went against him, pretty much. We always knew that was going to be the case. So it&apos;s not as if the polls were radically off. That&apos;s not the issue. One thing that&apos;s quite useful, of course, is the fact that a popular vote win, which doesn&apos;t always line up with the electoral vote, creates more legitimacy for Trump. And the fact that this wasn&apos;t just a matter of one or two states, and that it’s clear that there was neither significant internal nor definitive external interference. Clearly, there was a lot of disinformation and, you know, bomb threats mailed in, called in by the Russians. But nothing that would have changed the outcome. And so you were able to not only get Kamala Harris to concede in short order, but Democrats across the board, whether or not they&apos;re happy with it, recognizing that Trump is indeed their president. So unlike in 2020, where Trump himself precipitated a very significant challenge, saying that the vote was rigged and undermining the legitimacy of the outcome, here, we do not have that. Furthermore, the Republicans have, as of now, taken the Senate. Of course, conservative justices have a majority on the Supreme Court, and the Republicans, in short order, are very likely, overwhelmingly likely, to have a majority in the House as well. And what that means is that the Trump administration will be able to pursue the agenda, both domestically and in foreign policy, that they have said that they wish to pursue. For example, on tariffs or on taxes, or on immigration. All of these things that Trump was running on and now will have a mandate to pursue. So that is the long and short of what happened on Tuesday. HW: So you talk about tariffs, you talk about taxes. A lot has been said about the fact that Americans were voting related to the economy and how they felt about the economy. Do you agree with that? And what do you think that Trump will do with fiscal policy when he actually comes into the presidency again? IB: Well, let&apos;s talk about what Americans voted on. They voted on a country whose direction they did not agree with. Over 70 percent of Americans, Helen, say that they did not agree with where the country was heading. And when that happens, it is very, very hard to win as an incumbent. And vice president Harris may not be the president, but she certainly had accountability for alignment with the policies of her Biden administration. And when she was asked on the media, when she started doing her media tour after the debate with Trump, you know, &quot;What would you do differently from Biden?&quot; Her response, and this is the most important question that you could ask her in this campaign, her response was, &quot;I can&apos;t think of anything that I would do differently.&quot; So most important question, worst possible answer. And she tried to amend that in various ways later on, but she was never able to really get away from what she would do differently from Biden and why she would do it differently. I mean, she moved a number of her policies in a more centrist direction, but she didn&apos;t really explain it. She didn&apos;t really disassociate herself from previous iterations of her policies. So pretty much everybody out there that was unsatisfied with where the United States is going felt like she did not represent change. I mean, she&apos;s younger, she&apos;s different, she&apos;d be the first woman. From a policy perspective, they didn&apos;t believe that she represented change. And of course, Helen, this is what we have seen around the world. In the developed world, every democracy that has had an election this year has voted against their incumbents. Canada is probably about to have one. They will also throw out Trudeau unceremoniously. A lot of developing countries, India. Modi was doing pretty well, now he&apos;s in coalition. South Africa, the ANC, for the first time since Mandela, now in coalition. Mexico, is the only country of note that had an election this year, in the year of elections, that actually returned the same party. And, you know, in many ways, because the Morena party and AMLO are still seen as the outsiders against a deep, entrenched, you know, sort of power of existing oligarchs, business, you know, and the like. But if anything, they&apos;re the exception that proves the rule. And so, you know, you and I know, we&apos;ve talked about this before, I expected that Trump would win. I didn&apos;t have strong confidence in that call because Trump was himself very unpopular. But to the extent that anyone you would think would win an election in this environment globally, it was Trump&apos;s to lose. And, you know, he was able to pull it through. So I think that&apos;s the backdrop for what people were voting about. And specifically what it is, it is inflation, which is high and it&apos;s been coming down, but the overall prices, it&apos;s not like the prices are lower than they were a year ago, just because the inflation rate is coming down, those prices are still very high and you can&apos;t get away, run away from that if you&apos;re Harris. Immigration, something that, frankly, the Biden administration was very late to recognize was a problem not just in red states but in blue states, too. And those numbers are coming down, but the illegal immigrants that came to the US are largely still in the US. And then also disinformation, a large amount of disinformation that has made it almost impossible to have a national debate on policies and issues. And an awful lot of people, even that align with Harris&apos;s policies didn&apos;t necessarily believe that she was implementing them or Biden was implementing them. A lot of people in America think that the inflation rate is still the highest ever, think that unemployment is a lot higher than it has been. And the people that say that and believe that were far more likely to vote against the incumbent. So I would say, you know, in descending order of importance, what drove this election was inflation, immigration and disinformation. And that is something that we have seen all around the world this year. HW: I think it&apos;s all incredibly interesting. And you said something interesting that I want to just double click on there, which is this idea that people have feelings about the way things are, and they don&apos;t necessarily know what the actual facts about a situation are. So this is also an election in which there has been plenty of disinformation, as you say. Elon Musk wrote yesterday on X, “You are the media now.” And I think we can argue a lot about how the media has covered the election, about the way that the media  reports things, the horse race, all of that vapidity, all of that type of thing. But am I alone in finding that type of statement both facile and alarming? And isn&apos;t that driving us even further into a future where there are these kind of fractured narratives or fractured truths that people have, that actually don&apos;t coalesce to reality or accuracy? IB: Well, when I saw it from Elon, I mean, I&apos;m like, I thought he was talking to me, and saying, &quot;Ian, you&apos;re media now.&quot; I&apos;m like, about time, right? I mean, here I am, a political scientist, I&apos;m talking to a lot of people. So yeah, they should be thinking about me as media. Of course that&apos;s not what he was saying. What he was saying is that the mainstream media, CNN, MSNBC, Fox ... You know, and by the way, he never includes Fox, even though Fox is every bit as much mainstream media as the other two because he likes one ideologically now, he doesn&apos;t like the other two, but you might as well have some intellectual consistency around it. His view is that all of those publications, cable news, that they are fake news because, you know, of course, he&apos;s not making money out of those. And that Twitter/X is real news and that citizen journalists are the real media. Now, I have a lot of things to criticize mainstream media for. I believe that they have gotten way too high on their own supply, focusing on their own interests, their own clicks, their own news, they&apos;re less trusted than they used to be. We see that across the country. They&apos;re more politicized. They&apos;re more for their own candidate, whether it&apos;s Fox on the right or CNN and MSNBC on the left. But at least the journalists on Fox not, you know, Hannity, but the journalists during the day that are writing the stories and bringing you the news, the journalists during the day on CNN and MSNBC, the journalists that are working on the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, not the opinion leaders, but most of the people that are actually doing the reporting, they have expertise, they&apos;ve been trained. And of course, the big difference between citizen journalists, if you want to call them that, in other words, people that are posting random information that they think about on social media, number one, they tend to have stronger biases because it is not their professional job to try to mitigate them when they present things. Number two, they aren&apos;t professionally trained, so they don&apos;t have as much expertise in how to deliver that message and how to ensure that a headline is a headline, and you follow through with arguments and you actually properly cite things and there&apos;s research. And then number three, a lot of the so-called citizen journalists, the verified citizen journalists that have blue checks, are bots and are anonymous and aren&apos;t actually people. Or are bad actors that are actively pursuing and displaying disinformation for their own purposes. And that is, of course, the antithesis of what information, political information is necessary to run a civil society. I deeply worry that we are in an environment where almost everyone I know, educated people in the United States that voted for Trump and voted for Harris believe things, believe some fundamental things about the political system in the US that are not true. I mean, the number of people that I have spoken to that believe that large numbers of non-citizens vote in the United States, which has been, you know, assertively researched and audited, and you&apos;re talking about less than 100th of one percent of Americans, non-citizens that are on the rolls. It is not an issue. And yet you wouldn&apos;t know that if you read Elon&apos;s posts, because he actively has worked to promote that lie as strongly as he can. And I think that&apos;s a horrible thing. And I have seen that, I mean, I saw it most recently, I know a lot of Democrats that believed, a lot of Harris supporters that believed that Trump actually called for Liz Cheney to be executed, to be in front of a firing squad. And if you had watched what he said in context -- that was taken out of context -- you know, he was not saying that. He was saying that she&apos;s a neocon who supports wars, like in Iraq, for example, and Afghanistan, and that how would she feel if it was her that was facing the firing, as opposed to the people that they are sending off, the soldiers they&apos;re sending off to die? Something I&apos;ve heard many Democrats and Republicans that are antiwar, far left and far right, historically say. So that environment, the fact that information is being used in service of a political agenda, and that is what matters to you, is one of the most damaging things I see facing democracies today. It is an unsustainable trajectory. We will not maintain our democracy if we continue with it. I get things wrong all the time. You know, I&apos;ll make an analytic call. And I thought Trump was going to win and he won. But back in 2016, I thought Trump was going to lose. And I had reasons to believe that. And I was wrong. And I came out and explained why I thought I was wrong. I get things wrong all the time, but I do it honestly. It&apos;s not in service of a political agenda. I work my ass off, as do all the analysts at Eurasia Group, to try to help people understand and explain what is happening in the world. And, you know, not just from a left or a right-wing perspective, or an American or a Canadian or a Russian or a Chinese perspective. And I travel all over the world and talk to people from all over the world to try to help inform that. That is a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the information that people digest today politically, and particularly today politically, in the two-year run-up to a 10-billion-dollar national US election. And that is no way to run a representative democracy. And all the people out there that are saying that they don’t believe in their media, and they don&apos;t believe in their elites, they don&apos;t believe in their political leaders, their Congress, their executive, even their business leaders, even their scientists, they don&apos;t believe in them, that&apos;s why they&apos;re saying that. Is because they&apos;re existing in an environment that they can no longer ascertain truth from fiction. That&apos;s not a sustainable place to be. HW: It seems like a deeply dangerous place to live in. You floated something yesterday that I hadn&apos;t heard and thought was really interesting. It was that potentially Musk might buy Truth Media. Have you thought any more about that? Do you think that might happen? And what does that mean if that does happen? IB: So first of all, I have a hard time imagining that Trump is going to, as president, be able to continue to own and and post on Truth Media. Now you know, unprecedented things can happen. And Trump has said that, you know, you cannot, as sitting president, commit a crime. So, I mean, in principle, that means that rule of law, as applies to him, is what he says it is. The Supreme Court has punted on that in terms of what an official act is. So, you know, we&apos;ll see where that goes. We&apos;re going to be in an unprecedented place. But certainly I could easily imagine ... First of all, I believe that Musk&apos;s 75 million dollars in favor of Trump is probably the smartest strategic political bet that I have seen made by a billionaire, by an oligarch in the United States in my life. I&apos;ve never seen one that I think is likely to pay off better, than what Elon just did. Remember, this was a Biden supporter and he turned off from Biden when Biden decided not to invite him to the electric vehicle summit. Because, you know, Tesla, even though it’s way in front on electric vehicles, isn’t a union shop, and Biden decided he was going to play politics with that, as opposed to lean into ensuring that the US has the best possible electric vehicle future in the world. Elon took exception to that, turned against Biden. And the rest, as we say, is history. Big own goal by the president. And I hope he&apos;s reflecting on how that was a really dumb thing for him to do. Leaving that aside, I think that Elon is now in a unique position to help formulate what the values of the United States are, and to distribute those algorithmically from himself with his hundreds of millions of followers and from the president of the United States. And there are ways that that could be used to promote American interests. There are ways that those could be used that are inimical to US interests. And again, I promise, if Elon does things that I think are useful, you&apos;ll be the first to hear it from me. So, for example, I was in China recently. I met with the leadership and I met with Wang Yi and members of the Politburo, many others. And Elon Musk had recently been to China, and he travels there frequently. And they all wanted to know from me, while Elon is presenting himself as the guy that can help ensure that US-China relations don&apos;t become maximally confrontational if Trump becomes president. Is that true? Is he the guy? And of course, Elon has very, very strong business interests in China, developing artificial intelligence with Chinese scientists, Tesla on the ground manufacturing and selling into the Chinese market. China is very important for Elon. And certainly, Elon would not want there to be a decoupling between the US and China. And I think that he&apos;s going to have a lot of influence over US tech policy, especially because Trump didn&apos;t really have a technology policy in his first term. He had a tariff policy on China. But the CHIPS Act and the export controls on semiconductors, that was all done under Biden. And so, Elon, to the extent that he cares about anything, it&apos;s going to be technology policy. He&apos;s going to have, I think, a very strong position to be able to help determine who&apos;s appointed in those key technology positions under Trump, and also what kind of regulations, subsidies, stimulus will be enacted by a Trump administration for technology, broadly speaking, and of course, for Elon&apos;s own companies, which I expect he&apos;ll benefit from mightily. Now the question will be, is Elon going to be able to facilitate a more functional relationship between the US and the Chinese in advanced technologies? And the answer to that may well be yes. And if Elon helps avoid a cold war between the US and China, I will absolutely say that. Now we know that Trump has had a strong view on wanting to enact much stronger tariffs on China for a very long time, well before he got involved in politics. He&apos;s thought the tariffs were, you know, a critical component of US economic and foreign policy. Trump&apos;s &quot;America First&quot; means more capital in the United States, more jobs in the United States. It means, you know, bringing back, reining in free trade and market access, and instead using the power of the dollar and of the size of the American market and the strength of industrial policy to get other countries around the world to nearshore with the Americans. And Lighthizer in particular, who I expect will run trade in some manifestation under Trump, has said he wants to see 60 percent tariffs on all Chinese exports. Well, I mean, is Elon going to be able to, you know, help facilitate a deal on that with a China that is facing very serious economic challenges right now? And the answer to that is untested. That&apos;s a very interesting proposition that the Chinese are hoping Elon will help with. And he has said, &quot;I&apos;ll be able to help with.&quot; Now if it turns out that he’s able to help with that, this guy is absolutely golden in the United States and in China. He could become the most powerful person on the planet. If he is not able to do that, then he will be in a personal position of having directly disappointed the Chinese president and their leadership, and I would not want to be in that position. That strikes me as a challenging position to be in for someone who does a lot of business in China. So that&apos;s going to be an incredibly interesting thing to watch, Helen, I mean, we&apos;re going to see this play out. Again, we have a lot of pieces that are moving geopolitically around the world. This is only one, there are other really big ones, Europe, the Middle East. But this is one that&apos;s really, really interesting. HW: Super interesting and some very big personalities that will be arguing constructively about it all, I&apos;m sure. OK, so let&apos;s talk about foreign policy. Let&apos;s get into it. Zelenskyy obviously reached out to Trump almost immediately that he won the election and was very complimentary to him. So what is going to happen with Russia, Ukraine? What are you seeing there? IB: And how could Zelensky not, Helen? HW: Totally. IB: You know, he is a master communicator. He&apos;s been out there marketing himself and his cause with everybody. Trump has even called him, like, doing the best sales job on the United States. And on the one hand, that&apos;s critical because Trump thinks that the US is spending far too much on Ukraine. On the other hand, it&apos;s begrudging admiration because Trump sees himself as the best salesperson out there, right? So, I mean, you know, as my mom would say, &quot;Don&apos;t shit a shitter.&quot; And she used to always say that when she was alive. I saw a flash of my mom in Trump&apos;s comment there. I think that the fact that Zelenskyy said, &quot;Congratulations, great win.&quot; You know, &quot;We had a wonderful meeting together in the United States in September, and I want to work with you.&quot; That is not likely to be reciprocated by the great man, the president-elect. I suspect that he wants to end the war. He has said he will end it in 24 hours. Now Trump does exaggerate. It might not be 24, it could be a long weekend. There could be bathroom breaks in there. But he has repeatedly said, “I’m going to end this war. Don’t even need to be president, I can just do it in the lame duck.” What does that mean? Well, it means he wants to stop the fighting. He really does. And to be fair, I know a lot of people in the Biden administration, running the Biden administration, that want to end the war because they think that the Ukrainians are losing, and it&apos;s going to get harder and harder over time. But you’ve got to convince Zelenskyy to do that. Now what I expect Trump will do will be call Zelenskyy, call Putin and say, &quot;You&apos;ve got to freeze the conflict where it is, no more fighting. That means Russia, you basically are occupying the territory you&apos;re occupying, but you don&apos;t get to keep bombing the rest of Ukraine. Ukraine, you&apos;ve got to take it. But you don&apos;t have to worry about defending your cities. And then we&apos;ll sit down and we&apos;ll have negotiations on what that&apos;s going to look like going forward. And if you don&apos;t accept that, Ukraine, I&apos;m cutting you off, and Russia, I&apos;m putting more sanctions on.&quot; That is the opening gambit that Trump intends, mano a mano, to end the war. So, Helen, there&apos;s a couple of very interesting things that then happen. One is, is Zelenskyy prepared to accept that to begin negotiations? Can he get to a limited ceasefire, a freezing of the conflict? Under a Biden administration, the answer would have been clearly no. His position is much worse in a Trump administration. We will see how he responds. The consequences would be very negative if he says no, but he could say no. Politically, it&apos;s very hard for him to say yes. You know, he could lose power if he does. He will certainly undermine his position with a lot of Ukrainians that had been bravely fighting, supporting those that are bravely fighting. The Russians, you know, much easier for them to say yes if Ukraine says no. If the Ukrainians say yes, you know, I&apos;ve been speaking to some folks advising the Kremlin. I&apos;ve also heard from others in the last 24 hours that have said, well, Putin wouldn&apos;t be prepared to accept that unless there were other things like Ukraine is disarmed, can&apos;t join NATO, all of that. Would Trump put any of that on offer? Would he be capable of putting a lot of that on offer, given where the Europeans are? How does Putin react? If Putin says no, what&apos;s Trump going to do? That&apos;s an interesting question. But Helen, the most important question is that the Europeans are not likely to be consulted by Trump. And if they are consulted by Trump, he certainly doesn&apos;t worry about coordinating a united policy with them and Ukraine before he contacts the Russians. Biden wouldn&apos;t even talk to Putin, and he wouldn&apos;t consider a negotiation with the Russians until the Ukrainians and the Europeans were all onboard. That is absolutely not what Trump&apos;s position is. So what we have to look at here is whether the Europeans are going to take a more united front, confronted with a Trump that most of them really don&apos;t agree with. Will Europe be stronger together, facing not only Trump giving the Ukrainians an ultimatum and talking directly with Putin, but also doing things like threatening tougher sanctions, tariffs against the Europeans? I mean, we already know that Viktor Orban in Hungary is more inclined to work with Trump. He&apos;s made the Mar-a-Lago pilgrimage and all the rest. Well, what about Giorgia Meloni, who&apos;s quite close to Elon Musk, ideologically oriented to Trump, but has been very anti-Russian and has a lot of popularity in Italy right now? Might she shift away from Ukraine towards Russia in support of a Trump policy? We don&apos;t know. What about Germany? They&apos;re about to have new elections. What&apos;s a new German chancellor? We don&apos;t even know who that person is. We don&apos;t know how well the far right in Germany would do in those elections, how much more aligned they might be to Trump. So one of the most important questions geopolitically will be, do the Europeans hang together in support of Ukraine with a much tougher set of relations with the United States, or do they fragment with a meaningful number of them embracing Trump, flipping on Russia and saying, &quot;We don&apos;t care about Ukraine anymore&quot;? And if the latter happens, what happens to the front-line states in Europe that see Russia as an existential threat? Poland, the Baltic states, the Nordic states? I mean, these are questions that we will have answers to in very short order, but right now we are completely in no-man&apos;s land. These are unanswered questions right now, and they could go any which way. And all of the European leaders I&apos;ve spoken to in the last 72 hours, they are mightily concerned about exactly this issue. This is priority number one for them. HW: Alright, so we are more than a year into the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. Obviously there&apos;s a lot going on there. We have talked before about how you thought that Netanyahu would be holding out until Trump got elected, was hoping for that to happen. It has happened. So what do you think happens next in the Middle East? IB: Yeah, I thought it was very hard to imagine that he was going to agree to a ceasefire where Biden would be seen as the broker, he had no interest in that. He wanted Trump. By the way, the Israeli people want Trump. There was a “Jerusalem Post” survey recently. I think it was over 60 percent of Israelis say they wanted Trump and 12 percent said they want Harris. That&apos;s the biggest gap we&apos;ve seen with the US ally. And it&apos;s because Trump, when he was president, he did the Abraham Accords. He recognized the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel, as Israeli territory. He moved the US embassy to Jerusalem after many presidents promised to do it, Trump actually did it. So, I mean, Trump&apos;s bona fides as a very strong pro-Israel president, even stronger than the pro-Zionist Biden, is a really big deal. Remember, Trump&apos;s first trip as president was to the Middle East. No American presidents do that. He went to Saudi Arabia, then he went to Israel. So I&apos;m not surprised that the Israelis and that Netanyahu in particular are very, very comfortable here. I think that the question, first of all, I still think there is room for Biden to get a negotiated settlement with the Israelis and Hezbollah. They are close. If you made me bet right now, within two weeks, maybe three, in other words, in the lame duck, I think that there will be a settlement between Israel and Hezbollah. They&apos;ll stop the fighting. The Israelis, and particularly the prime minister, are not looking to destroy Hezbollah the way they have Hamas. They are looking to push Hezbollah back, get the Israelis that have been evacuated back into their homes, back to their schools, and then stop the fighting. Netanyahu understands that this is a much bigger fight that would cause a lot more damage to the Israeli economy, that he doesn&apos;t necessarily want over the long term. He&apos;s also done a lot to destroy Hezbollah&apos;s leadership and degrade their military and communications infrastructure. So that is a narrow win that I think can be taken off the table in the Middle East. Gaza is very different. I don&apos;t see any change in Israel&apos;s policy on Gaza. I think the humanitarian crisis for the Palestinians living in Gaza will actually get worse, if you even believe that it can, it will, particularly in the occupied north, and especially as UNRWA, which is the United Nations agency that actually is responsible for the infrastructure and for bringing humanitarian aid in, has been just voted by a large majority of the Israeli Knesset as illegal. They will no longer work with it. So, I mean, really anything that looked like it was the potential to build infrastructure for governance in Gaza has either been bombed away or is being unwound. And so I think this is even more of a disaster for the Palestinians. I don&apos;t see any move towards a two-state solution, towards independent governance by the Palestinians, towards anything that would stabilize in the near term. Iran is the big question. So Trump has criticized Biden for constraining the Israelis in their response to the Iranian strikes of 180 ballistic missiles against Israel. Didn&apos;t kill any Israelis, but they did launch those missiles. And they did actually strike Israeli military targets. And Jared Kushner has recently written some notes that he&apos;s circulated around on how this is a unique opportunity for the Israelis to rid themselves of the Iranian nuclear threat once and for all. So unlike Biden, who has worked to prevent the Israelis from striking Iranian energy and nuclear targets, it appears that Trump is goading them to do precisely that. Now there&apos;s a very big question. Is he getting them to do it while Biden is still president? And then they end all of that and Trump can say, &quot;I ended the war, I came in,&quot; or would he rather wait until he&apos;s president so he can coordinate militarily, provide the intelligence, all the rest, between the United States and Israel to together &quot;handle&quot; the Iranian threat? But I do believe the likelihood of an expanded military confrontation between the US and Iran is relatively high. Now remember, when Trump was president, he ordered the assassination of the head of the Iranian military, Qasem Soleimani, and the Iranian response was to do virtually nothing. And there were those, like the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, who at the time were saying that Trump wanted to go even much harder against Iran than he ended up actually doing. So I mean, Trump, I think, probably does believe that the Iranians are a paper tiger and that this is a great opportunity for Israel and or the United States to take care of that problem. That&apos;s a very interesting point. Also, let&apos;s keep in mind that the Iranians, who have been involved in interfering in the US election, like China, like Russia, but unlike Russia, who wanted Trump, the Iranians want Harris. And the Iranians have tried to assassinate Trump and Mike Pompeo and others involved in the Trump administration, something that I&apos;m honestly very surprised hasn&apos;t gotten more attention in the US media. So I think for many reasons, Trump and a Trump administration would feel like it is time to hit the Iranians back pretty hard and show them that you don&apos;t mess with a Trump-led America. So yeah, again, I think that this is a big deal. And from a global perspective, if that were to happen, that would lead to much higher oil prices, at least for a period of time, because the Iranian capacity to disrupt the Straits of Hormuz and prevent a lot of oil from being transited globally is significant. HW: So you talked about Milley, you talked about Lighthizer. Who do you see as making up Trump&apos;s cabinet? Who do you think is going to be appointed? We know a lot of people have said they wouldn&apos;t come back. What are you hearing and what should we be watching for? IB: Well, certainly not Milley, who ran the Joint Chiefs, since he&apos;s recently said that he thinks Trump is a fascist. So I think that&apos;s probably table stakes for you&apos;re not getting a position. I don&apos;t think he wants one either. The funny thing is that so many of the people that were in the previous Trump administration now consider Trump to be an enemy and it is mutual, right? I mean that is -- One of the interesting things will be to what extent Trump decides to go after them as president. Will he launch investigations from the DOJ? You know, might they be more likely to face an IRS audit? Will Trump-influenced media go after them to a greater degree? I mean, those are all interesting questions, and we don&apos;t know the answer to it. In many ways, I think that Trump actually does hold a grudge against them, people that he thought were loyal and then turned against him, more than against leaders in the Democratic Party. But, you know, again, that is right now a hunch. That is not in any way borne out in fact. But in terms of people that I think will be around Trump, I do think that they&apos;re going to look for adults. They are going to look for people that are capable of doing their job, but they will not go for independents that Trump doesn&apos;t have control over, even though their Republican bona fides are strong. They did a lot of that the first time around. So, you know, you had Rex Tillerson appointed as Secretary of State, who Trump had never met before and who his own advisers said, &quot;This guy is not aligned with any of what we want, any America First. He&apos;s CEO of ExxonMobil.&quot; And Trump says, &quot;Yeah, but look at him. He looks like a Secretary of State.&quot; That is not what we will see this time around. I think that loyalty will be very, very important. He will want people that will not turn coat on Trump in three and six month&apos;s time, in a year&apos;s time, in a future administration, in a future election. There are some people that I continue to hear time and time again. So people that were heavily involved in the campaign that were seen to facilitate Trump and make him successful. Howard Lutnick, who originally said that he didn&apos;t want a position, he just wants to help Trump. But now that he&apos;s spent a lot of time with Trump is feeling like, “I really do want a job, I’d like to be Secretary of Treasury.” Well, I think he has a good chance of getting that job. I think Linda McMahon, same, from the World Wrestling [Entertainment]. Very close to Trump, very good friends. For a long time now she wants to be Secretary of Commerce. Good chance she would get that job. I think that on State, there are a lot of names. Bill Hagerty, the senator, former ambassador to Japan, steady, capable pair of hands. Certainly interested in that job, would be in the mix. But frankly, lots of people, will be in that mix, I think Ric Grenell, the former acting head of national intelligence, before that, ambassador of the US to Germany, well-known on social media and on Fox. A little more incendiary, more like, willing to be a bomb thrower in public. More of a populist, Trump likes him a lot. He really would like to be Secretary of State. He&apos;ll certainly be interviewed for that position. I think there are others, you know, I&apos;m hearing Mike Waltz, member of Congress, very smart guy, very capable, potentially for Secretary of Defense. Pompeo, Mike Pompeo does not look to be an insider right now. He took a long time before he was willing to endorse Trump. And I think the loyalty is open to question. Hasn&apos;t gotten as much access at Mar-a-Lago and with Trump as a lot of other people have. Some of the key questions will be what happens with the so-called power ministries, as we define them around the world the Department of Justice, the FBI, the IRS. Will they be politicized? Will they be weaponized? I do think it&apos;s very hard to imagine someone like Bill Barr, who is very conservative, very smart, but not a Trump loyalist. At the end of the day, someone that was going to ultimately, you know, vote and act according to his values and ideology as opposed to Trump&apos;s all the time. I think that is not acceptable for an Attorney General in a second Trump term, in the same way that Mike Pence was not the selection for VP, it was JD Vance. And a lot of people say, oh, JD is like, really powerful and he knows politics and he&apos;s going to run the shadow cabinet, and he&apos;s going to be in charge of appointing everyone. No he&apos;s not. Trump will not tolerate someone to have his star power working for him. I think there will be priorities that are Trump&apos;s. And when he has priorities, he will be in charge. And I think there will be lots of different centers of power that will fight and compete over areas that Trump doesn&apos;t really care as much about, and then we&apos;ll see that play out. So in that regard, it is likely to look very different than the first Trump administration. HW: This is the Trump show. So just to wrap things up, I guess a very simple but profound question, which is, how are you feeling about the future? IB: I think that the United States continues to be the most powerful country in the world. It has the reserve currency, it has the most powerful global military, it&apos;s producing the most energy, it dominates the field of artificial intelligence, which is the most important set of new technologies that humans have ever been able to have their hands on. So I mean, there’s a reason why people are betting on the US markets, on the US dollar in this environment after a Trump victory. But the global order is in very deep disarray. There is an absence of global leadership, and that absence will be felt more strongly and more profoundly in a Trump, America First second administration. You know, a lot of allies of the United States around the world are allies because they have shared interests but also because they perceive that they have shared values. And those values include commitment to democracy and rule of law and the promotion of democracy and rule of law around the world. Commitment to a multilateral architecture where norms and values are largely agreed to. Collective security among allies and to the extent possible globally. Free trade and market access through multilateral agreements that become more committed and higher standard over time. I think that what we have just seen with this election is that the American people do not actually accept those values, and that the American president-elect does not accept those values. So US allies around the world have to recognize that they still may have a lot of shared interests with the United States, but they no longer have those shared values. Biden, to the extent that he had a core global principle, it was really about autocracies versus democracies, the bad guys versus the good guys. Trump completely rejects that. Trump&apos;s view is, &quot;I don&apos;t care what kind of a political system you have internally. I want to know, can I do a deal with you? And if you&apos;re Putin or Kim Jong Un, or if you&apos;re Trudeau or Claudia Sheinbaum, if I can do a deal with you, I will do a deal with you. And by the way, I&apos;m going to do that deal unilaterally, where I have a lot more power. I&apos;m not going to do it in a multilateral setting where a bunch of you think you can gang up on me and force me into constraints.&quot; So I think that we&apos;re in an environment where our challenges are increasingly global, where our ability as human beings to affect the world that we live in are increasingly systemic and structural. And yet the availability of global leadership is not only absent, but is decisively rejected by the American people that have most upheld it over the past decades, for good and for bad, and by its president-elect. So that’s probably the thing that I am most concerned about and that I think will cause the greatest uncertainty, volatility and danger in the coming years. HW: Ian, it is always a pleasure talking to you. Sobering but fascinating. Thank you so much for your time and we will speak again soon, I&apos;m sure. IB: My pleasure, Helen."

HW: Shu, welcome to TEDNext. Thank you so much for being here. ST: Thank you very much for a nice opportunity.  HW: How did you get into yo-yoing? ST: So I&apos;m Shu Takada from Japan. I’m a six-time world champion, as she introduced me. For me, yo-yo isn’t only a toy but also an art form and a tool that I can express myself [with] on the stage. Anyway, I started yo-yo when I was six years old because of my father, who did it as a hobby. When I saw his trick for the first time, I was so impressed and found it so cool. But to be honest, I felt a little bit jealous while he was showing off his techniques. And I swore to myself that one day I will surpass his level. So that&apos;s how I started yo-yo. HW: And what do you love about yo-yoing? ST: So what I love about yo-yoing is that you can express yourself with such a small tool, and you can bring it everywhere. You can play it everywhere. And I think this is really cool to make new friends all over the world, even though they can&apos;t speak the same language as you. HW: I love that. And what are you going to show us today? ST: So today, since my topic is beyond the yo-yo, I’d like to share a new style of yo-yoing, which you’ve never seen before.

552167,alexander_h_toledo_how_do_kidney_transplants_work,Alexander H. Toledo,How do kidney transplants work?,https://www.ted.com/talks/alexander_h_toledo_how_do_kidney_transplants_work,"In the 1930s, doctors began experimenting with a procedure  long thought to be medically impossible:  an organ transplant. Many pioneering surgeons focused on the kidney, taking a healthy one from a living or recently deceased person and transplanting it into a patient dying from kidney failure. But these early surgeries faced a major problem: patients’ immune systems would quickly recognize the new kidney as a foreign object and start to destroy it. Few patients survived past the first few days. Then, in 1954, Joseph Murray attempted a type of kidney swap that no doctor had tried before. The surgery was a success, and the patient would go on to live the next 8 years with the transplanted organ, thanks to one key factor: it came from his identical twin 70 years later, upwards of 100,000 kidneys are transplanted annually in the US alone. So how does this surgery work today? Kidneys are true workhorses— these fist-sized organs filter the equivalent of an entire bathtub’s worth of blood each day. In addition to removing this waste and extra fluid through urine, the kidneys also regulate the production of red blood cells, vitamin D, and other hormones. Certain medical conditions can prompt the kidneys to work overtime, leading to gradual deterioration. For example, in diabetes, higher blood sugar concentrations can trigger increased kidney filtration, swelling, and inflammation. High blood pressure can constrict and damage the organ’s delicate blood vessels. Over time, people can lose complete function of their kidneys and must rely on a treatment called dialysis to survive. Yet dialysis is time consuming and fraught with serious medical complications. A kidney transplant offers a more permanent solution with a dramatically improved quality of life. Once a patient is approved for the surgery, the search for a suitable organ begins. Historically, the biggest barrier was finding a donor whose immune system makeup closely resembled that of the patient’s,  like an identical twin, as to reduce the risk of organ rejection. But today, thanks to medical advances, a patient’s family member, friend, or even a stranger can donate one of their kidneys. New drug therapies can effectively suppress a patient’s immune response before and long after the transplant, meaning that patients and donor pairs no longer must be perfect matches. Still, the closer the match, the better. So another option is a paired organ exchange, where two or more incompatible donor and patient pairs are matched up, allowing each patient to receive a more compatible kidney from the other pair. Once an organ is found, the surgery itself is straightforward. First, the living donor&apos;s kidney is removed using minimally invasive and often robotic techniques. As for the transplant patient, an incision is made in their lower abdomen and the donor organ is implanted. The new kidney’s artery and vein are connected to the recipient’s to create blood flow, and its ureter is attached to the patient&apos;s bladder. The failed kidneys are typically left in place, allowing them to continue to aid in filtration. After surgery, a patient is closely monitored for the next several days to ensure the new kidney starts filtering their blood, and subsequently producing urine on its own. This new kidney typically lasts between 12 to 20 years. Some people will have multiple kidney transplants in their lifetime, meaning at some point they may have four or even five kidneys in their bodies. As for donors, most leave the hospital the next day, and can resume normal activity within a few weeks. While all surgeries carry risks, most donors go on to lead normal, healthy lives,  facing no, or relatively few, complications related to living with a single kidney. But not all patients will have a willing living donor. In the US alone, around 90,000 patients sit on the national waiting list to be matched with a kidney from a deceased donor.  While many people register as organ donors, only 0.3% will lose their lives in circumstances that allow for organ donation.  Due to this organ shortage, about 17 patients die every day waiting for a new kidney. Thankfully, doctors continue to push against the limits of what&apos;s possible, exploring new treatments and the potential of lab-grown, 3D printed, and even artificial kidneys."
544424,hrund_gunnsteinsdottir_listen_to_your_intuition_it_can_help_you_navigate_the_future,Hrund Gunnsteinsdóttir,Listen to your intuition — it can help you navigate the future,https://www.ted.com/talks/hrund_gunnsteinsdottir_listen_to_your_intuition_it_can_help_you_navigate_the_future,"You all know that feeling, that sense of overwhelm when confronted with an urgent task, thinking if I only try better, work harder and you put yourself aside time and time again because there are bigger things to think about. When I started working for the United Nations just after the war in Kosovo, it felt like walking into an open wound, and I was determined to give it all I had, knowing that the people who had suffered war were my priority, while my own well-being was not. In early 2002, when I was traveling for work from Kosovo to Kazakhstan, I felt this terrible pain and I started to bleed. I didn&apos;t think much of it. I just took painkillers and continued with work. It was only years later that I realized I&apos;d had a miscarriage, and instead of this being a wake-up call, I just kept plowing on, deepening my disconnection with my body and my emotions. Soon after, I was in the unique position of having a guaranteed job at the UN for life, which had been a dream of mine. But at the UN in Geneva, the heavy bureaucracy and hierarchy felt all-consuming. My sense of purpose got weaker, and I felt increasingly out of touch with the living world. So I left my job at the UN, thinking we are serving system instead of serving people and the planet. And I thought something needed to change inside me. And I also felt our systems were out of sync. And maybe this feels familiar to some of you. Those of us who work in climate and sustainability work on transforming or changing systems. But systems don&apos;t change themselves, right? It&apos;s people like you and me that together change systems. But I don&apos;t think we can help big systems change in the long run unless we connect within and the change starts from within us. And lucky for us, there is this beautiful Icelandic concept that can help us do that. My soul searching brought me to intuition, which in Icelandic is called “innsaei.” And in the company of some amazing colleagues, I&apos;ve been able to practice, research and interview scientists, spiritual leaders and artists from around the world. And I&apos;ve discovered that we all have intuition, and it&apos;s up to us to tune in to it, which can be quite a challenge in today&apos;s world. Intuition is fundamental to our intelligence, and I don&apos;t think we give it the attention that it deserves. Unconsciously, we process a massive amount of information, sensory data that our body picks up, including the brain. While this is unconscious, it still shapes our actions. Our very focused conscious mind can grasp only a tiny fraction of all this data processing. Intuition helps us tap into this information. It helps us &quot;read the room,&quot; come up with insights, and tune in to other people and the world around us. Sometimes we dismiss intuition as an irrational impulse that we shouldn&apos;t rely on, or a woo-woo concept that hasn’t been backed by science. But research shows the catalyzing role intuition has for creativity, compassion, mental agility and the human genius. We actually need good intuition to reason well, and without intuition, there wouldn&apos;t be much innovation. A research on a group of Nobel laureates showed the key role intuition played in their discoveries, and as they shifted between analysis and intuition, it led them to their big leaps. My search for answers brought me back to my roots and helped me see with fresh eyes the Icelandic word for intuition, &quot;innsaei.&quot; Innsaei helps us reframe intuition because it brings together the scientific and the spiritual, the solid and the poetic. Innsaei means the sea within, and refers to the ever-flowing unconscious mind. The sea within cannot be put into boxes because then it ceases to flow. Stress, work and financial pressures can block our access to innsaei. And while we can&apos;t get rid of these pressures, we can learn how to clear the way to innsaei when we need it. Meditation and mindfulness practices can help us do that as they regulate our nervous system, and we gain clarity in mind. Intuition picks up information with all our body, so next time you feel something&apos;s off, you get chills down your spine or a gut reaction, ask yourself, what is my unconscious trying to tell me? Innsaei also means to see within, to be self-aware, and one of the most powerful ways to see within is to pay attention to how you pay attention and document it. Attention journaling helps you witness how innsaei plays a role in your life and how best to harness it. And lastly, innsaei means to see from the inside out and has to do with how we navigate the ocean of life from within with a strong inner compass. Aligning with innsaei is the work only you can do. And allowing innsaei to flow sometimes involves finding the balance between being and doing. And for many of us, it actually takes discipline to simply be and allow the world to come to us. One of the most powerful ways I&apos;ve seen innsaei have an impact in the world is through the work of my dear friend, the ocean explorer Enric Sala. When we first met, he was introduced to me as the man who had left academia in order to spend most of his time in the ocean to help save it. I was intrigued, and I have since then interviewed him both for our film and my film and my book about the role innsaei has played in his pioneering work. Enric&apos;s childhood dream was to become a marine biologist and after having spent seven years as a university professor, Enric felt as if he was writing the obituary of the ocean instead of providing a cure. So he left his job, and he went on to found the National Geographic Pristine Seas Project, where he is able to immerse himself in the ocean and explore its ecosystems in a team of scientists and filmmakers. Spending time in the ocean has helped Enric enormously develop his intuition about what&apos;s wrong with the ocean and how to bring it back. Since 2008, Pristine Seas has been able to establish 27 of the largest marine protected areas in the world, covering an area more than twice the size of India. Enric&apos;s story supports research that shows that intuition gets deeper and better with experience, knowledge and expertise. Also, how we immerse ourselves in the world, consciously or unconsciously, shapes how we show up and how we navigate it. The world we live in is very much like the ocean. It&apos;s constantly changing and we need to decide which direction to go. We are now midway into the decisive decade for climate change. We’re taking stock, renewing our understanding and agency. As we wayfind and change systems, we also need to renew our focus and vision. And I think innsaei can help us in three ways. First, like Enric&apos;s story shows, it helps to see the big picture and how everything is interconnected. And secondly, innsaei grounds us in the present, enables us to be more in charge of our own attention and therefore better prepared for the unexpected. And lastly, as we immerse ourselves in a given task and we connect dots beyond man-made silos, our creativity, focus and performance improve. As we navigate towards new horizons, we need our vivid imaginations to set sails towards the possible. Grounded in innsaei&apos;s innate understanding of planetary and human interconnectedness, imagination can guide us towards the futures that we dream of. It helps us see in our minds what we intuit to be possible. Because if we can&apos;t imagine better futures, how on earth are we going to get there? Thank you. (Applause)"

549389,dan_kwartler_the_real_reason_polio_is_so_dangerous,Dan Kwartler,The real reason polio is so dangerous,https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_kwartler_the_real_reason_polio_is_so_dangerous,"In 1952, polio was everywhere. For years, this virus killed or paralyzed roughly half a million people annually,  leaving survivors reliant on crutches, wheelchairs, and respirators. Yet just 10 years later, paralytic polio cases in the US dropped by 96%. Soon, similar trends spread worldwide, and it looked like we were on track to eradicate polio for good. But in the 21st century, the virus started striking back. So, what’s the source of these recent spikes, and how can researchers fighting polio finally get rid of this deadly disease? To answer these questions, we first need to understand the true danger of polio. Most infected individuals only present mild flu symptoms or no symptoms at all, with paralysis occurring in less than 1% of cases. Which is why the real danger of polio is how infectious it is. Historically, there have been three strains of poliovirus, all of which typically enter our mouths from airborne droplets or contact with infected fecal matter. This means polio runs rampant in communities with poor sanitation. And once infected, individuals remain contagious for 3 to 6 weeks, spreading a silent outbreak with few trackable symptoms. This is what made polio unstoppable until US physician Jonas Salk found a solution in the early 1950s. He created an inactivated version of the virus that, when injected, prevented all three strains from causing paralysis. However, this inactivated poliovirus vaccine, or IPV, didn’t stop poliovirus from living in our bodies and spreading to others. Fortunately, Polish American microbiologist Albert Sabin was creating the oral polio vaccine, or OPV, at the same time. This even cheaper and easier to administer treatment contained weakened variants of each poliovirus strain,  known as attenuated viruses, And once ingested, these prevented polio from settling in the body altogether. Over the next several decades, IPV and OPV eliminated polio in country after country. But near the turn of the century, this arms race between medical ingenuity and viral evolution took a turn. Scientists discovered variant strains of polio— each almost identical to one of the three existing strains. And their source was even more troubling. Up to this point, one of OPV’s greatest advantages was that its attenuated viruses could spread just like wild polio, moving through the air and immunizing unvaccinated individuals. But researchers discovered that if these weakened viruses circulated for several weeks in under-vaccinated populations, they could mutate into new vaccine-derived strains. To be clear, this didn’t mean the attenuated vaccine was inherently dangerous. OPV had already been used to stop wild poliovirus type 2 worldwide and eradicate all wild poliovirus from the Americas, West Pacific, and countless other countries. The issue was ensuring populations met a certain vaccination threshold— specifically, at least 80% of every community needed to be vaccinated to prevent strains from mutating. So, in our current fight against polio, we&apos;ve taken two approaches to this problem. First, vaccine developers have made even safer forms of OPV. Monovalent and bivalent OPVs  respectively contain one or two types of attenuated poliovirus, reducing the number of strains that could possibly mutate. These vaccines helped eradicate wild poliovirus types 2 and 3, and today they’re tackling the last remnants of type 1 poliovirus in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Vaccine researchers also developed OPVs targeting vaccine-derived polio. Currently, most polio cases are caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 outbreaks in Africa and the Middle East. So researchers created a new vaccine specifically to tackle this strain with minimal risk of mutating. Second, medical workers on the front lines are using cutting-edge technology to ensure every population meets that 80% threshold. Digital tools like geospatial imaging and analysis help them locate and immunize remote communities. Extensive monitoring systems ensure they don’t miss a single child. And waste surveillance systems employed across the globe can alert us to potential outbreaks. Today, the fight against polio is at a critical moment. We’re primed to eradicate wild poliovirus in the near future, and with our new vaccines, eradicating vaccine-derived strains might not be much further off. But doctors still struggle to reach areas  experiencing military conflict and civil unrest. And without keeping vaccination rates high, polio’s silent outbreaks could easily surge. So it’s essential that we keep up the pressure  to finally finish what we started over 70 years ago."
549033,ketakandriana_rafitoson_democracy_is_being_tested_citizen_assemblies_can_help,Ketakandriana Rafitoson,Democracy is being tested. Citizen assemblies can help,https://www.ted.com/talks/ketakandriana_rafitoson_democracy_is_being_tested_citizen_assemblies_can_help,"I’m from Madagascar, and on my way to Vancouver -- and I can swear it’s a pretty long trip -- I watched a movie on the plane. And I stumbled into a nice quote saying, “People are driven by misery to revolution.” And I told myself that would make a fantastic intro to my talk, because, you know, this is a story of misery, but also of resistance and revolution. Almost 80 percent of the Malagasy people live in extreme poverty, and they are in survival mode every day. Madagascar is a really fantastic country. Very beautiful, very rich in terms of biodiversity, natural resources, land, people, culture. But at the same time, we are lacking the most basic things such as food, electricity, education, healthcare, roads, energy, everything. Politicians promise us the moon, but they just deliver dirty governance, corruption and misery. We don&apos;t have a fair and just society where people have a say on decisions made on their behalf. And we don&apos;t have democracy. This is a notion that remains blurred to many of our people. But it doesn&apos;t have to be this way, and this has to radically change. So for the last 20 years, I&apos;ve been working for the democratization of my country in various instances. And of course, power holders don&apos;t like that. But it&apos;s OK. I&apos;m not here to please anyone, frankly. The most important thing -- (Applause) The important thing is to keep preventing dictatorship from happening in my country and to keep fighting against corruption at all levels. So what I wanted to tell you about today is something that we launched within our community. It&apos;s called citizen assemblies. The idea is just to gather ordinary people from all walks of life around the idea of learning about democracy, deliberating about important public questions and then taking actions together. And we do believe that citizen assemblies can be a powerful way for restoring democracy, not only in Madagascar, but elsewhere around the world. The first aim of those assemblies is to ensure that everyone understands what a true democracy looks and feels like, and then to give them practical tools in order to engage them into practical actions. Because, you know, there is so much confusion around the notion of democracy. If you walk around Madagascar, you will hear lots of definitions, things going from absolute freedom or no rules. And the confusion with anarchy is sometimes compelling. So we need to tell people how it is really, and we need to fill this knowledge gap about democracy. Because when people don’t have the right information in hand, they are more vulnerable to political propaganda, which in turn takes even more power out of their hands. So that&apos;s the idea. And here I would like to say that in those assemblies, we really go beyond lofty ideals of democracy, because what we want to trigger is a collective strategy for really improving people&apos;s lives. So those who join us are totally free to pick whatever issue matters to them and any burning question. And we want to solve this together and make tangible impact. The philosophy is to educate, empower and then engage into democratic action. And that&apos;s exactly what we are doing through our citizens assemblies. So how does it work? Every week in various locations, flexible locations, we are convening a group of 10 to 20 ordinary people, regardless of their age, gender, level of education, social status or employment, whatever. And because of security reasons, we only rely to our former participants, and we ask them to bring new people each time for the next assembly on the same location. And the gathering style is really a mix between World Café deliberation and a caucus. And we always start with very basic questions such as what is democracy? And does my voice as a simple citizen matter? Newcomers sometimes feel skeptical and hopeless because they think that their fate lies only in the hands of the government. But very rapidly they shift their mind, and they start to open up. And then we discuss those practical issues, and we find solutions together. In these assemblies, when people bring their issues, we are also connecting them with safe whistleblowing platforms for reporting corruption. And this works. I&apos;ll give a practical example. In 2018, an investigation from the Malta Network exposed that a member of Parliament was planting illegally some crops in a protected area on the west coast of Madagascar. That area is named Menabe Antimena. So almost half of this dry forest, a very unique landscape, has been slashed and burned for the last decade, as you can see from the maps. This Member of Parliament then hired migrants to work illegally in this area, and he bribed local authorities for silencing them as he spread terror in the whole county. So this case was brought to our assembly, and people were discussing about it and decided to take action. So with the help of local civil society organizations, this assembly of small farmers, teachers, journalists, people from local churches, they gathered evidence, and they asked the prosecutor to act. Following that, the Member of Parliament, who was reputed to be untouchable, has been sentenced to prison and convicted of murder. Since -- (Applause) Since, he escaped from prison and threatened our journalists, but nonetheless he has been sentenced and convicted for additional criminal charges. This story shows the power of citizen assemblies, because those ordinary people felt the power of getting together and daring to act together. That&apos;s it. So in order to enhance the dynamic of the citizen assemblies, we launched the learning initiative aiming at nonviolent action or Lina, a Malagasy word meaning keen to learn. And this work builds on the teaching of American political scientist Gene Sharp, and it aims to really teach people about tactics and methods of nonviolent civil resistance. So with the help of the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict, we crafted a curriculum and we converted it into a film for non-literate audiences and to a guidebook for citizens, grassroots organizations and civil society organizations. And through these tools, we are teaching people how to organize peaceful protests, how to face police violence, and how, importantly, to build, nurture and sustain a movement. And when the time comes for action, we encourage people to really do this with their own means. Because we don’t have any kind of funding, and the idea is really to trigger a revolution from the inside. We have a medical doctor who is ready to assist in case of injury. We have a lawyer ready to assist if someone gets arrested. And we have people bringing us colorful pens and markers for drawing nice placards for the protests. These are neighbors. These are friends, ordinary people, just, you know, from various profiles, but brought together by the idea and dream of a better democracy and a more just society. I do believe that the power of citizen assembly brought a positive shift in Madagascar because despite the shrinking civic space and despite the fearful reprisal, people are protesting more and more. We witnessed that during the pandemic, when nurses and doctors dared to go on strike for claiming their extra wages. I know that may sound very common to you, but for us that was something. It’s very unusual, and that happened. We also saw teachers resisting political instrumentalization during the last elections, and we saw women breaking the silence around the rape culture and the impunity surrounding it. And more and more of our communities dare to really claim their lands and report land grabbing perpetrated by greedy politicians. So that&apos;s a sparkling and the magic of citizen assemblies. Of course -- (Applause) This work is very draining. This is very frustrating. Because it takes time to build this people power. We would like the revolution to happen now, but we have to be patient, OK? But nonetheless, sometimes we feel really frustrated, and we are about to give up, I tell you. But witnessing the small, tiny victories that people are achieving, that keeps us going because they are chipping away at injustice. And we all know today that democracy is backsliding around the world. But we need a remedy. The combination of citizen assemblies and civil resistance can make that difference. This year is a special year. Democracy will be tested more than ever before around the world, as almost half of the population is going to vote in various kinds of elections in 70 countries. Let&apos;s seize this momentum to build a global movement of citizens empowered, you know, to take back the power, we need that now. And I would like people to feel that they have the power within their hands. I want them to feel that their voice matters. And I want them to stand with a mission, breaking injustice and breaking the status quo. It&apos;s high time that we restore democracy back. And it is us, the citizens of this world, who can make that happen. And now is the time. So, you know, it all starts with a conversation. And I really hope that you will remember this one that we had today. Let us bring the power back to the people. Thank you. (Cheers and applause) Helen Walters: Thank you so much, Ketakandriana. I just had a few quick questions. So you referred to this being a draining experience. It&apos;s also, I just want to be clear, it&apos;s pretty dangerous. So how do you, like, talk to us about that and talk to us about your personal commitment. KR: I mean, we are constantly attacked, you know, because of our anti-corruption commitment, because we are also outspoken about things happening in Madagascar. But I will say that it&apos;s very fair because we are ready to go for it. We know that there is a price to pay when you are reporting bad things. I think it&apos;s the same all over the world, so we are ready for that. But the thing is, you know, I have maybe a network, I have some colleagues who can protect me. But what about ordinary people in rural areas who don&apos;t have anyone to protect them? This is unfair and unjust, and that&apos;s why we need to break this system. HW: So you also referred to -- (Applause) You also referred to using small wins as ways to charge and boost yourself. Can you give us an example of a recent small win that has given you strength? KR: Oh yeah, of course. So we have this unit of investigative journalism, and we are conducting a lot of investigations, and there is one on sexual corruption happening in schools and universities in Madagascar, that we are really proud of because we exposed that. And it is now raising awareness among our community. Because some people in Madagascar do consider that this is a traditional thing, that we don’t have to complain about that. But it’s not the case. So raising this awareness drives people to sue the perpetrators of sexual corruption to court. So that&apos;s a win. We&apos;re happy about that. HW: Ketakandriana, thank you so much. KR: Thank you so much for having me. (Applause)"

What&apos;s left behind by one organism becomes fuel for another. It was human beings that invented the idea of waste. Of using things once, then throwing them out. In many ways, waste has driven human progress. Disposable diapers helped women get out of laundry rooms and into the workforce. Disposable plastic syringes enabled mass vaccination, saving hundreds of millions of lives. And even the most dramatic example of human progress, space travel, has been powered by single-use rocket boosters. But this most significant of human inventions, waste, is today so successful that it threatens our very existence. Each year over 150 billion disposable diapers and 16 billion disposable syringes end up incinerated, in landfill or simply polluting the environment. By 2050, there may be more plastic waste than fish in the world&apos;s oceans. And outer space is now so full of waste that it&apos;s jeopardizing future missions. In the industry I work in, fashion, waste is a particular problem. Over the past 20 years, fashion consumption has increased by 400 percent. Yet 85 percent of materials produced eventually end up incinerated or sent to landfill. The relentless production of new materials accounts for 38 percent of fashion’s greenhouse gases and is one of the reasons fashion is the third most polluting industry in the world. Fashion is an industry built on waste. And while some companies are making good progress in setting carbon reduction goals, using recycled materials, or offering trade-in and resale programs, few are daring to challenge the fundamentals of the fashion system. But as our climate crisis escalates, it&apos;s clear that this linear system cannot continue. This is what I was thinking four years ago, as I was at home with my young kids during COVID, feeling increasingly anxious about fashion&apos;s future and my role in contributing to that future. At the time, at my company, Coach, we were taking many steps to improve the sustainability of our brand, including launching programs to give used and damaged products a second life. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized this wasn&apos;t enough. To solve the problem of waste, we would have to reinvent it and the system that created it. This is what led me to create Coachtopia, a new Coach sub-brand designed not to improve our linear fashion system, but to pioneer a circular one in which products are made with waste, designed for multiple lives and have clear circular pathways so those materials stay in circulation. We reframed our understanding of waste. Let me explain. First, we had to make our waste visible. In fashion, we normally create products without thinking about the waste we generate. In fact, when we first started looking for our waste, it was actually hard to get the full picture. We measure what we make, not what we leave behind, but these waste streams are vast and deep. For example, this is the waste left behind from the making of products such as our quilted tabby shoulder bag. As you can see, the scraps left over from the cutting of the bag patterns are not easily usable. They&apos;re small, scrappy, irregular. Typically, across the industry, these scraps are sent to landfill almost without a thought. But there are up to 30 percent of each leather skin. At first, the scale of the problem seemed daunting, but we soon realized that the scale was actually the opportunity. That, in fact, we could create a whole new supply chain built on waste. So we started collecting, sorting, classifying and storing our leather scraps. And now, instead of a pile of waste, we have a rich supply of materials collected in what we call our leather scrap yards. Next, we had to reimagine the value of waste. Thinking of it not as a byproduct, but as an inspiring raw material. And it started with reversing how we design. In the usual process, we design forwards. We imagine the ideal product and the ideal materials and colors, and we harness the power of our supply chain to bring this vision to physical life. But in a circular world, we have to design backwards, starting with what already exists and using our creativity to turn those materials into beautiful new products. This was scary. What if we wanted pink but there was no pink? What if the only pinks that were available were the wrong shades, no longer on trend this season? What if we fell in love with the color of scrap but there wasn&apos;t enough? Or we ran out before we could make enough units? Our challenge was to see these constraints not as obstacles, but as opportunities for innovative design. This is what led us to create our signature checkerboard pattern, which we created to help us put a system of order on the often unpredictable, continually changing nature of our raw-material supply. The checkerboard allows us to easily swap in and out different colors while maintaining the same system of scalable production. Along the way, we had to learn to embrace imperfection. In the luxury world, we often talk about uncompromising quality. But as Coach, the American house of leather, we&apos;re also responsible in some part for defining what quality means. An &quot;aha&quot; moment was when we went to one of our partner factories and saw the parts of the leather they trimmed away because the grain was uneven. The natural grain of the highest-quality leathers had become a defect, to be trimmed away, because it didn&apos;t fit an aesthetic preference for uniformity. In that moment, I realized just how much the way we consume is linked to the way we make. I myself was one of those consumers who asked to see three of every bag when I shopped in a store, looking for the perfect one, without any marks or imperfections, without thinking about the fact that to get a perfect finish, you need to waste more materials. Seeing these perfectly usable materials thrown away really brought home the fact that the idea of waste is closely tied to what we choose as a culture to find beautiful. As producers of fashion, we&apos;re responsible for helping create this ideal of beauty. And so it&apos;s important at Coachtopia that we challenge it. Finally, we had to shift from designing with waste to designing out waste. In Coachtopia, we set out to transform the waste Coach generates into beautiful new products. But once we started really thinking about waste and what we choose to consider waste, we had to ask ourselves another question. What if, rather than reimagining waste once it was already created, we started thinking about it before it was created. So we looked at our upcoming lineup of Coach bags, and then we thought about the waste that would inevitably be a byproduct of producing those bags. And here is what we created. This is a bag designed specifically to be made from the waste of our top-selling quilted tabby shoulder bag. We transformed the small and irregular leftover scraps of leather, some of them rejected because of their natural grain, and stitched them together to create a whole new bag with a 59 percent lower carbon footprint than the comparable style made with new materials, and also a 46 percent lower price than the quilted tabby, as we pass on the savings of using these scraps to our consumers. And now we&apos;re applying this approach more broadly to other top styles: the Brooklyn, the Hamptons and more. It&apos;s luxury born out of waste. We&apos;re beginning to build a whole new system that&apos;s more like nature, where what&apos;s left behind by one entity, Coach, is used by another, Coachtopia. And that makes me so happy because I love fashion. I love the joy it brings us and the way it allows us to express ourselves. I believe that the steps we&apos;re taking, though, of course imperfect, will help us build a new kind of fashion that doesn&apos;t come at the expense of the planet. But what I&apos;m even more inspired by is the idea that by changing the way we both make and consume, we can start to build a future where waste isn&apos;t the unwanted consequence of linear growth, but the fuel for a new model of progress, a circular one. Thank you. (Applause)"

551459,leopoldo_lopez_how_to_defend_democracy_and_fight_autocracy,Leopoldo Lopez,How to defend democracy — and fight autocracy,https://www.ted.com/talks/leopoldo_lopez_how_to_defend_democracy_and_fight_autocracy,"So today I want to talk to you about something that has been at the core of my existence for the past years: freedom and democracy. I was elected mayor of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, in the year 2000. I was reelected in the year 2004. And then in the year 2008, when I was running for higher office, I was banned to run for office. Because we were going to win. At that time, we started a movement, a nonviolent civil resistance grassroots movement that went all over Venezuela and worked with people all around the country to build a network that could face off the dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro. In the year 2013, Maduro was elected. He stole an election. And in January of 2014, we called for protest. Tens of thousands of people went to the streets. And that took me to prison. I spent the next seven years in imprisonment, four of them in solitary confinement in a military prison. The history of my country, Venezuela, is one, like many other Latin American countries, African countries, one of military rule, exile, imprisonment and politics. So I had read a lot about what it meant to be in prison. I read the usual suspects, I read about Mandela, I read about Gandhi, I read about my [role] model, Martin Luther King. But I also read a lot about the experience of Venezuelans, including my great grandfather, who had been a political prisoner for years and died in exile. Everything that they had to say was relevant to their own condition, but they all spoke about the importance of having a routine. So I had my own routine since day one, February 18 of 2014. My routine was simple. I would do three things every day. I would pray to take care of my soul. I would read, write, to do something with my mind. And I would do exercise. I did those three things with Spartan discipline every day. If I did them, I would feel that I was winning the day. But there was one thing that I would think about every single day: why I was in prison. And in fact, this is something that I&apos;m sure happens to all prisoners, political prisoners or not. That&apos;s what prison, in a way, is made for. So every day I thought about what freedom and democracy meant. And it was there in a cell, two by two, in solitary confinement that I really got to understand what freedom was. And it became clear to me that freedom is not about one thing. In fact, freedom is about the possibility of doing many things. So the possibility to speak out, to express your mind. It&apos;s the possibility to move around in your country. It&apos;s the possibility to assemble with whomever you want to assemble, to pray to whomever you want to pray, to own property. And all of those things were taken away from me and from millions of Venezuelans. And it also became very clear to me that freedom and democracy were two sides of a coin. Were interdependent. You cannot have freedom without democracy. You cannot have democracy if people are not free. So that took me to think about the state of democracy. In fact, next month, in November, we&apos;re going to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 35 years. Back then, I was in grad school. It was the &apos;90s. And I remember the excitement that was everywhere about spreading democracy, spreading freedom, human rights, all over the place. I remember my teachers going to different countries with students. But when we look back 35 years ago and we fast forward, things didn&apos;t really come out the way it was expected. Only 10 years ago, 42 percent of the world&apos;s population was living under autocratic rule. That was 3.1 billion people. That&apos;s around the same time I was sent to prison. Today, 72 percent of the global population is living under some sort of autocratic rule. So let&apos;s think about this. This is 5.7 billion people in the world that don&apos;t have the rights that most people in this room have. They can&apos;t speak freely, they can&apos;t move freely, they can&apos;t pray freely, they can&apos;t own property. 5.7 billion people in the world. After seven years of imprisonment, I was able to escape prison and went into exile. Exile is another form of imprisonment. At the beginning, it was tough. But then I started to meet other people like myself, who had been leading protests in their countries, who had been political prisoners, who were in exile. And we were very different in any way we could think about: our skin color, our religion, our languages, the story of our families, the history of our countries. We were very different. But when we spoke about what it meant to fight for freedom and to confront autocracies, I was with my buddies. It was the same people, the same movement. So we decided to create an alliance of democracy defenders and freedom fighters. So alongside with Garry Kasparov, from Russia, and an incredible woman from Iran, Masih Alinejad, we decided to create an alliance of freedom fighters and democracy defenders. And that&apos;s how we created the World Liberty Congress, which is an alliance of hundreds of leaders, many of them you have seen their work in Hong Kong, in Russia, in Belarus, in Uganda, in Zimbabwe, in Afghanistan, in Cambodia, Nicaragua, Cuba, in many countries. And we decided to work together, to come together with a single purpose: to stop autocracy and to bring democracy to our countries. But it became very clear to us that we were not only facing our local autocrat, we were also facing a network of autocrats, an axis of autocrats. And this is something that might not be obvious to many people. But in fact, autocrats work together. They support each other. In many ways: diplomatically, financially, militarily, through their kleptocratic networks. And this is not an ideological alliance. It has nothing to do with ideology. Right, left, conservative, liberals, nothing to do with that. It has to do with power, money and a common enemy: democracy. So that&apos;s why you have the nationalists from Russia, the theocrats from Iran, the communists from China, working together under a similar alliance. So if autocrats are working together and the world is coming to a point where 72 percent of the world&apos;s population is under autocracy, it&apos;s time to think about why should you care about this? Why should everybody, anybody care about this? Why should someone who’s living in the United States or in Europe or in a functioning democracy care about this? Well, if you care about climate change, if you care about gender equality, if you care about women&apos;s rights, if you care about human rights, if you care about corruption, if you care about migration, you need to be concerned about the rise of autocracy and the need for democracy. 30 percent of the CO2 emissions come from China and Russia alone. 80 percent of the world’s poverty comes from autocratic countries. 90 percent of the forced migration, and we from Venezuela can speak about this, has at its root cause autocracy. So we need to care about this. And what can be done? What can be done about this? Well, I believe that we are now at a moment where we need to make a tipping point of the engagement of people around the world to create a movement towards freedom and democracy. Think about the climate change movement 20, 30, 40 years ago. It was not mainstream. It was there, but it was not mainstream. But then what happened? Researchers, governments, policymakers, activists, artists, school teachers, students, children, everybody came together under the same cause. Because I remember during the 1980s, &apos;90s, you would look up to the sky and you would think that there was an ozone hole in the sky that was going to destroy. So the threat was very clear. People came together, policy came together, and now it&apos;s mainstream. Things are being done. I believe we are at that point with respect to democracy and freedom. If that trend continues, today 72 percent, if that trend continues, maybe in the next 25 years, in 2050, the entire world would be autocratic. And that is less than a generation ago. So we must take action. What can we do? Well, the first thing I believe is to assume that we need to take the offensive. Stop legitimizing autocrats. Autocrats today are comfortable. They do business with governments, with businesses. We need to think of smart sanctions, of ways to make them accountable for the violations of human rights. Second, there needs to be a support for pro-democracy and freedom movements. In the United States, that is the most actively philanthropic society in the world, only two percent of philanthropy goes to democracy-related issues. Only two percent. And a fraction of a fraction of that two percent goes to promote democracy outside the US. It&apos;s not a priority. So supporting pro-democracy movements, supporting the people that want to be free, should be a priority for all. And I mean, let me give you some examples. Technology. Access to internet, to free and uncensored internet. Think of the potential transformational capacity to give people all over the world access to internet. Let me give you another example. Using new technologies like Bitcoin to promote and support the potential of these movements. We are doing this already. In the case of Venezuela, we supported more than 80,000 medical doctors and nurses using Stablecoins and Bitcoins because under autocracies you are under a financial apartheid. Give opportunities for training. Give opportunities for these movements to be part of a global conversation. And finally, we need to build a global movement. There is not one person, one organization, one government, that can do this by themselves. Similar to climate change. We need to think of this challenge as a network. We need to create nodes of network, nodes of network that activate all over the place. We need to activate anyone with the things that they can do. Musicians should think about singing for freedom. Artists, intellectuals, researchers, activists, governments. Everybody can create their own node with a similar goal, which is freedom and democracy. When I was in solitary confinement, I had a window, and I could see through the crack of that window that there was a tree, and in that tree there was a hawk. And I contemplated that animal for hours and hours and hours. I only think that you contemplate an animal that long if you&apos;re in biology or you&apos;re in prison. And one day, a guard told me, because I was always telling the guards about the hawk, he said, &quot;You know, the hawk is injured, went through barbed wire, and he’s injured.” And I said, &quot;Bring it to me.&quot; And to my surprise, they brought it to me. Maybe because they thought it was going to die. I fed that hawk. And that&apos;s the hawk in my cell. That&apos;s a drawing I made of the prison I was [in], of that tree and of the hawk. And then one day, after a couple of months, they came to my cell, they threw a blanket on the hawk, they took it away. Of course it affected me. But less than a day after, that hawk was in the same tree. And it reassured me that it doesn&apos;t matter how low you are, how low percentage possibilities you have to succeed, there is always possibility to do so. So I came out and being in exile, I met a tattoo artist, that put me a tattoo of Venezuela on my leg, so I now have that eagle here, and I have it always with me. (Applause) As a reminder, as a reminder that we can always rise up to all of the challenges. So I ask all of you to stand up, to speak out, to do something about our freedom. This is our time. Think of 25 years, and let&apos;s give our children a free world with human rights, democracy and respect for all. Thank you very much, thank you very much. (Cheers and applause) Thank you. (Cheers and applause continue) Helen Walters: Thank you, thank you, Leo. Audience: Venezuela libre! Leopoldo Lopez: Venezuela libre,  hermano, Venezuela libre. HW: OK, Leo, I wanted to ask you a few questions, and actually Venezuela is one of them. So there were elections in July, Maduro says he won the election, observers says he did not. But what are you hearing? What is the situation in Venezuela right now? LL: Well, so let me explain this very briefly. The case of Venezuela has been an electoral autocracy. So we&apos;ve gone to elections for years. And we&apos;ve been developing the ways in which we can know exactly the results. On July 28, there was an election, we had a candidate, Maria Corina Machado, she was disqualified the same way I was disqualified years ago. So we had another candidate, Edmundo González. He was unknown three months before the election, but he became known by everybody. And on the 28th of July, he won with 70 percent of the vote. The decision of Maduro was to steal the election. But we were able to prove with elements of every single voting machine, that we actually won. Maduro decided to have a repression all over the country. We went to the election with 300 political prisoners. Now there are maybe 2,500 political prisoners. I wake up every day to get a message from someone from my movement who has been taken to prison, That&apos;s the situation now. But I can assure you that we will be free. Because one thing is to think that you are a majority, and a very different one is to know. Everybody knows that we are a huge majority, and that will not be sustainable for Maduro because we will never surrender. And we will be free. (Cheers and applause) HW: OK, so we were just chatting backstage and you mentioned that today is a very special day, and I want to bring up a photo. And I wonder if you can tell us what today is for you. LL: Well, today is the fourth anniversary of me meeting my family. This is my family, that’s my wife, Lilian, more than my half. You know, people say &quot;my second half.&quot; No, no, it&apos;s just three quarters of who I am, my beautiful wife, Lilian. And these are my three kids, Manuela, who is now 15, Leo, who is 11 and Federica, who is one. And I had not seen them for almost two years. I had not seen my kids and my wife. And that’s the day, exactly four years ago, after I escaped, I met them back in Spain. So it&apos;s an important day for us. And I’m very grateful that Lilian is the woman who’s the mother of my kids.  Because she was an incredible mother while I was away, and she was an incredible advocate for the freedom of all political prisoners when I was in prison. HW: Leo, you’re an icon. Thank you, Leo Lopez. LL: Thank you very much."

They were expecting someone... When a knock finally sounded at the door, Mr. White rose and welcomed his old friend, Sergeant-Major Morris. Time flew as the sergeant regaled the family with epic tales from faraway lands— until Mr. White asked about an artifact the sergeant had alluded to. Slowly, the sergeant produced the object from his pocket: a mummified monkey’s paw. He explained that, in order to teach the consequences of meddling with fate, a holy man had imbued the paw with the power to grant three wishes to three men. The sergeant said he’d obtained the paw after the first man made his final wish for death. When Herbert asked why he hadn’t used his wishes, the sergeant tensed and replied simply that he had. Suddenly, he flung the paw into the fire, but Mr. White yelped and plucked it out of the flames. And despite the sergeant’s warnings, Mr. White persuaded him to part with the paw. After their guest had gone, Herbert playfully suggested that his father wish for the rest of their home’s mortgage money. Mr. White chuckled and wished for £200. But just as the utterance left his lips, he screamed out in terror. The paw had curled in his grasp. The Whites soon bid each other good night. But as Mr. White sat staring into the dying flames that flickered in the fireplace, they morphed into blazing faces before him. He reached for a water glass to extinguish the apparition, but as he did, the monkey’s paw grazed his hand ever so slightly. The morning&apos;s light soothed the night&apos;s disquiet, and the family joked with one another about the paw’s magical powers. Herbert left for work, and Mr. and Mrs. White passed their day as usual. But as evening loomed, Mrs. White noticed a man at their gate, who appeared to be deliberating whether to enter. She ushered him in and he broke the news: Herbert had died, caught in the factory machinery. To the Whites’ horror. the company would reward them compensation, the man went on, in the form of £200. They buried Herbert at a cemetery down the road, and over the following days, the cold, heavy grief of their loss settled upon the home. One night, as Mr. White tried to comfort his weeping wife, she bolted up, possessed by an idea. They still had the monkey’s paw— and Mr. White had two remaining wishes. He could will their son back to life. Yet the thought of the monkey&apos;s paw and Herbert&apos;s mangled body, reanimated after 10 days buried, petrified Mr. White. Mrs. White, however, was insistent. She hurried him downstairs to find the paw. And, moved by his wife’s desperation, Mr. White clutched it and wished for Herbert to be alive again, then let the monkey’s paw fall to the floor. At first nothing happened,  and Mr. White felt a sneaking sense of relief. His suspicions that the paw was just an inanimate token and the death of his beloved son a sick coincidence were affirmed. But as he lit a candle, a gust of wind extinguished the flame. A moment later, Mr. White heard a tap at the door. Gradually, it crescendoed into a booming knock. He tried to restrain her, but Mrs. White rushed to the door. Her shaking hands struggled with its stubborn bolt, and she begged her husband for help. Mr. White, however, was scrambling on the floor in frenzied horror, hands outstretched, searching for the monkey’s paw. The knocks quickened and crashed at the door. And with a final force, Mrs. White shrieked and wrenched the bolt free as Mr. White managed to seize the paw and choke out his third and final wish. The door opened to reveal their empty, lamplit street, and a frigid draft of air rushed into the house... Thus concludes W.W. Jacobs’ 1902 short story, “The Monkey’s Paw.”"

Well, if we believe former Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, we all have been napping since the early 1990s. At least geopolitically speaking. Why? Well, join me at the Munich Security Conference, one of the world&apos;s foremost conferences on national security and defense, on the 19 of February, 2022. Five days before the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine. With 190,000 soldiers waiting at the border. Leaders such as Kamala Harris, Ursula von der Leyen, Antony Blinken and Volodymyr Zelensky are discussing the future of war and peace in Munich. In this unique, historic and tense situation Prime Minister Morawiecki urges the world to wake up from years and decades of geopolitical napping. So you&apos;ll get a wake-up call. In fact, when we look at our realities -- personal, business, political -- we see the outsized impact of geopolitics on all our lives. Now, what is interesting is that while companies are struggling with the challenges of AI revolution, of high interest rates, of labor shortages, of climate change, they tend to overlook geopolitics. Luckily, I think that we have a window of opportunity to really up our game. To develop what I call the geopolitical muscle. No worries, I have no shares in any gym chain. But I think that developing a geopolitical muscle, meaning having the possibility to understand the challenges and the navigation of the new realities, is key. Now, talking about new realities. I lead the BCG Henderson Institute and BCG&apos;s Center for Geopolitics. And in this role, I have spoken, over the last two years, with 500 CEOs, executive committees and boards around the world, literally from southern Chile to northern Japan. In these discussions, my counterparts asked me, &quot;Nikolaus, how will the world in the 2030s be? How is our future?&quot; Well, I&apos;m not an oracle. But I like to work with scenarios. What are scenarios? Scenarios are images of the future. And you know what&apos;s really beautiful about scenarios? They are precisely wrong, but generally right. So what&apos;s the most favorite scenario all over the world, from southern Chile to northern Japan? It&apos;s a scenario which we call &quot;back to the future.&quot; It&apos;s actually the world of the 1990s, the early 2000s, a time where democracy was prevailing, free trade was flowing, international organizations like the UN, WTO, World Bank were functioning. And of course, many of us grew up in this period. So no wonder that we want to be in a scenario like this one. But I have bad news for you. This scenario is very unlikely. Then there are other extremes. People saying we will end up in a global escalation of conflicts. We have seen huge conflicts with huge humanitarian toll and macroeconomic impact in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in Sudan. And we see here, obviously the worry of these people to say, well, will we see a proliferation of conflicts, notably in the Indo-Pacific, which will lead to an economic Armageddon? Well, here I tend to be slightly more optimistic, and I believe that this scenario of global escalation, notably because of the deep interlinkages in the Indo-Pacific, political and economic, is not likely to happen, at least in the short to medium term. So now you will ask me and say, &quot;Nikolaus, OK, so no &quot;back to the future,&quot; no global escalation, so what&apos;s happening?&quot; Well, I think the most likely scenarios for the 2030 is the multipolar world. What does it mean? Well, since 1945, we had a world that was dominated by one or two superpowers. I believe that the 2030s will see many powers, many spheres of influence. And let me go through a few of them. First, there is what I call the Western bloc, the United States, Europe, allies in North America, allies in Asia Pacific. This bloc is characterized by democracy and market economy. This bloc is collaborating technologically in topics such as AI, renewables, medtech and so on. Even militarily, this bloc has evolved. We have seen the reawakening of NATO as a response to the war in Ukraine and the US has developed a very interesting network of alliances in the Asia Pacific, including countries such as Japan, Korea, India, Australia and others, under interesting acronyms such as AUKUS or Quad. Then there is a second bloc, which I describe as the new Eastern Bloc. And that&apos;s actually China and Russia growing together with countries such as North Korea and Iran joining this bloc. The economic reality is that Russia is pumping gas into China via pipelines with the name Power of Siberia 1. And China is sending cars to flood Russian roads. But also, technologically, this bloc is trying to become independent, be it space exploration, semiconductors or and so on. The most interesting part of it is that technologically and militarily, this bloc is going to a completely different level. If you see the Iranian kamikaze drones in the skies over Kiev or the joint naval drills of the Iranian, the Russian and the Chinese navies in the Gulf of Oman, March of this year, military cooperation is becoming reality. And then there’s a third bloc. And I don’t call it bloc. I don’t want to call it bloc, because I think it&apos;s more of a grouping of countries, where we have a series of middle powers, regional powers such as India, Indonesia, the GCC countries, that are playing a role of staying in balance between those two blocs. These countries have huge assets, be it natural resources, abundant talent, interesting geographical position. And they leverage these assets to develop a non-aligned path between the two other blocs. And they develop spheres of influence across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. So we are in this multipolar world. What does this mean for companies and corporate leaders? Companies and corporate leaders need to navigate and they need to develop a geopolitical muscle. Remember, corporate workout. So let me go through five exercises that companies need to do. First, build resilient supply chains. The operating model where you used to have a large factory at the lowest possible cost location on Earth, is dead. We have seen how pandemic, war and tariffs are destroying supply chains overnight. The new reality is you need to have a network of small factories all over the world. You need to have flexible supply chains that are able to respond to external shocks. Exercise two. Prepare for continued inflation and price volatility. I know no one wants to hear it, but I think the current discussion of price cuts is interesting. But the reality is that the cheap money of the 2010s is gone. Much more real is a continuous inflationary pressure we will see through geopolitical shifts, increased military spending and the cost of energy transition. So companies need to prepare in their investment and pricing decisions how to handle this continued inflationary pressure and pricing volatility. Third, design your organization for a fragmented world. The time where you were handling a company and a multinational company from one headquarter, is gone. In a world, in a multipolar world, where you have different economic systems, political ideologies and technical stacks, you will need to set up your company as a collection of regional command centers that are agile and independent and can perfectly adapt to the new realities. Fourth, prepare for cybersecurity. In a multipolar world where AI and asymmetric warfare are likely to become the new normal, companies need to prepare for cyber attacks, both on a system level, but also on an employee level and a culture level. Fifth, and this is the core of it, develop the geopolitical muscle. So what is it? It&apos;s about talent. It&apos;s about decision making. And it&apos;s about leadership. Talent. Companies need to hire and develop talent that is able to sense geopolitical shifts, that is able to think in scenarios, that is able to redesign supply chains, that is able to define new strategies. Second, decision making. While investment decisions and project decisions and strategies need, of course, to consider dimensions in finance, in legal and HR, it is critical to inject a geopolitical perspective in the way how you make decisions. And last on leadership, let me dream a little bit. I still think that managers continue to be good managers. But I would hope that their decision is also influenced by the way how historians, economists and politicians decide and think, in order to pivot their strategies to the new realities. So let me conclude this wake up call with a simple alternative. Either you continue with your geopolitical napping, (Laughter) or you build your geopolitical muscle. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
549045,lawrence_lessig_how_ai_could_hack_democracy,Lawrence Lessig,How AI could hack democracy,https://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_how_ai_could_hack_democracy,"So on January 6, 2021 my nation suffered a little bit of a democracy heart attack. Thousands of Americans had been told that the election had been stolen, and tens of thousands of them showed up because they believed the election had been stolen. And indeed, in polling immediately after January 6, “The Washington Post” found 70 percent of Republicans believed the election had been stolen, and a majority of college-educated Republicans believed the election had been stolen. That was their perception. And I don&apos;t know what the right way to act on that perception is. They thought the right way was to defend what they thought was a democracy stolen. Now, these numbers were astonishing: 30 percent or two thirds of Republicans believing the election was stolen. But even more extraordinary are these numbers. The fact that in the three years since that astonishing event, the numbers have not changed. The same number believe today that the election was stolen as believed it was stolen three years ago, despite the fact that we&apos;ve had investigations and overwhelming evidence that there was no fraud sufficient to ever change even a single state. This is something new. When Richard Nixon went through the Watergate scandal, as the news was being reported, Nixon&apos;s popularity collapsed not just among Democrats, but among independents and Republicans. But we&apos;re at a stage where it doesn&apos;t matter what happens. This is Donald Trump&apos;s popularity over the course of his administration. Nothing changes. The facts don&apos;t matter. Now I think this truth should bother us a lot. I think we need to develop a kind of paranoia about what produces this reality. A particular paranoia, the paranoia of the hunted. Think of the kids in &quot;The Birds&quot; first realizing that those crows were attacking them, or &quot;Black Mirror&apos;s&quot; Metalheads, when you see these creatures chasing and surrounding you. The point is, we need to recognize that there is an intelligence out there to get us. Because our perceptions, our collective perceptions, our collective misimpressions are not accidental. They are expected, they are intended, they are the product of the thing. (Laughter) OK, I want to be careful introducing the thing. I&apos;m going to talk a little bit about AI, but I&apos;m not going to slag on AI. I think AI is the most extraordinary technology humanity has ever even conceived of. But I also think it has the potential to end humanity. But I&apos;m not going to slag on AI, because I&apos;m pretty sure that our robot overlord is going to be listening to these TED talks someday, and I don&apos;t want to be on the wrong side of the overlord. So AI is just fine. I&apos;m not going to talk about this AI first. I want to instead put AI in a little bit of a perspective, because I think that we&apos;re too obsessed with the new, and we fail to recognize the significance of AI in the old. We think about intelligence, and we&apos;re distinguishing between artificial and natural intelligence. And we, of course, as humans, claim pride of kingdom in the world of natural intelligence. And then we build artificial intelligence. It&apos;s intelligence that we make. But here&apos;s the critical point. We have already, for a long time, lived with systems of artificial intelligence. I don&apos;t mean digital AI, I mean analog AI. Any entity or institution that we build with a purpose that acts instrumentally in the world is in this sense an AI. It is an instrumentally rational entity that&apos;s mapping how it should behave, given the way the world evolves and responds to it. So think about democracy as an AI. It has institutions, elections, parliaments, constitutions for the purpose of some collective ends. Our Constitution says it&apos;s for the common good. So the democracy in our Constitution is an analog artificial intelligence devoted to the common good. Or think about corporations as an AI. They have institutions, boards, management, finance, for the purpose of making money, or at least conceived of narrowly, today, that’s the way it is. There corporation is an analog intelligence devoted to maximizing shareholder value. These are AIs. They have purposes and objectives sometimes complementing each other. So the purpose of a school bus company complements the purpose of a school board to produce school bus transportation in a district. That&apos;s just beautiful. But sometimes they&apos;re competing. The purpose of a government and having a clean environment conflicts with the purpose of a coal company designing to produce electricity by spewing carbon and soot into the environment. And when they conflict, we tell ourselves this happy story. We tell ourselves the story that democracy is going to stand up and discipline that evil corporation. To get the corporation to do the right thing, to do the thing that&apos;s in the interest of all of us. That&apos;s our happy story. It&apos;s also a fantasy. Because at least in my country, corporations are more effective AIs than democracy. Think about it a little bit like this. If we think about instrumental rationality along one axis of this graph and time across the other, humans, of course, are the first instrumentally rational entity we care about, we&apos;re better than cows. Maybe not as good as ants, but the point is, we&apos;re pretty good as individuals figuring out how to do things strategically. And then we built democracy to do that a little bit better, to act collectively for all of us. And that&apos;s a more instrumentally rational entity than we, individual humans, can be. Then we created corporations. And it turns out, they have become, at least in corrupted political regimes — which, I’ll just submit, my political regime is — better than democracy in bringing about their objective ends. Now, of course, in this system, each of these layers has an aspiration to control the higher layer. So humans try to control democracy through elections. Democracy tries to control corporations through regulation. But the reality of control is, of course, a little bit different. In the United States, corporations control democracy through the extraordinary amount of money they pour into elections, making our representatives dependent not on us, but on them. And democracy then controls the humans by making representation, not actually representation, corrupting representation. Now, this structure, this layer of higher order intelligence or instrumental rationality might evoke, for those of you who think about AI, a statement by the godfather of AI, Geoffrey Hinton. Hinton warns us, &quot;There are a few examples of a more intelligent thing being controlled by a less intelligent thing.&quot; Or we could say, a more instrumentally rational thing being controlled by a less instrumentally rational thing. And that is consistent with this picture of AIs. And then we add digital AI into this mix. And here too, once again, we have corporations attempting to control their digital AI. But the reality of that control is not quite perfect. Facebook, in September of 2017, was revealed to have a term in their ad system called &quot;Jew Haters.&quot; You could buy ads targeting Jew haters. Now, nobody in Facebook created that category. There was not a human in Facebook who decided &quot;We&apos;re going to start targeting Jew haters.&quot; Its AI created that category because its AI figured Jew haters would be a profitable category for them to begin to sell ads to, and the company was, of course, embarrassed that it turned out they didn&apos;t actually have control over the machine that ran their machines that run our lives. The real difference in this story, though, is the extraordinary potential of this instrumentally rational entity versus us. This massively better instrumentally rational entity versus even corporations and certainly democracies, because it&apos;s going to be more efficient at achieving its objective than we are. And here&apos;s where we cue the paranoia I began to seed because our collective perceptions, our collective misperceptions are not accidental. They are expected, intended, the product of this AI. We could think of it as the AI perception machine. We are its targets. Now, the first contact we had with this AI, as Tristan Harris described it, came from social media. Tristan Harris, who started the Center for Humane Technology, cofounded it, famous in this extraordinary documentary, &quot;The Social Dilemma,&quot; before he was famous, he was just an engineer at Google. And at Google, he was focused on the science of attention using AI to engineer attention, to overcome resistance, to increase human engagement with the platform because engagement is the business model. Compare this to, think of it as brain hacking. We could compare it to what we could call body hacking. This is the exploiting of food science. Scientists engineer food to exploit our evolution, our mix of salt, fat and sugar, to overcome the natural resistance so you can&apos;t stop eating food. So that they can sell food or sell, &quot;food&quot; more profitably. Brain hacking is the same, but focused on attention. It&apos;s exploiting evolution. The fact that we have an irrational response to random rewards, or can&apos;t stop consuming bottomless pits of content with the aim to increase engagement, to sell more ads. And it just so happens, too bad for us, that we engage more the more extreme, the more polarizing, the more hate-filled this content is. So that is what we&apos;re fed by these AIs. With the consequence that we produce a people more polarized and ignorant and angry than at any time in democracy&apos;s history in America since the Civil War and democracy is thereby weakened. They give us what we want. What we want makes us into this. OK, but recognize something really critically important. This is not because AI is so strong. It&apos;s because we are so weak. Here&apos;s Tristan Harris describing this. (Video) &quot;We&apos;re all looking out for the moment when technology would overwhelm human strengths and intelligence. When is it going to cross the singularity, replace our jobs, be smarter than humans? But there&apos;s this much earlier moment when technology exceeds and overwhelms human weaknesses. This point being crossed is at the root of addiction, polarization, radicalization, outrage-ification, vanity-ification, the entire thing. This is overpowering human nature. And this is checkmate on humanity.&quot; Lawrence Lessig: So Tristan’s point  is we’re always focused on this corner, when AGI comes, when it&apos;s super intelligent, when it&apos;s more intelligent than any of us. And that&apos;s what we now fear. Whether we will get there in three years or 20 years, what will happen then? But his point is, it&apos;s actually this place that we must begin to worry, because at this place, it can overcome our weaknesses. &quot;The Social Dilemma&quot; was about the individual weaknesses we have, not to be able to turn away from our phones, or to convince our children to turn away from their phones. But I want you to see that there&apos;s also a collective human weakness. That this technology drives us to disable our capacity to act collectively in ways that any of us would want. So we are surrounded individually by these metalheads, and we are also surrounded as a people by these metalheads long before AGI is anywhere on the horizon. It overwhelms us. AI gets us to do what it seeks, which is engagement, and we get democracy hacked in return. Now, if the first contact that we had gave us that, if social media circa 2020 gave us that, what&apos;s this second contact with AI going to produce? When AI is capable, not just in figuring out how to target you with the content it knows will elicit the most reaction and engagement from you, but can create content that it knows will react or get you to engage more directly, whether true or false, whether slanderous or not. What does that contact do? I so hate the writers of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; because their last season, they so completely ruined the whole series. (Laughter and applause) We can&apos;t use memes from &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; anymore. But if we could, I would say winter is coming, friends, I&apos;m just going to say it anyway. Winter is coming, friends. And these AIs are the source that we have to worry about. So then, what is to be done? Well, you know, if there&apos;s a flood, what you do is you turn around and run. You move. You move to higher ground or protected ground. You find a way to insulate democracy or to shelter democracy from AI&apos;s force or from AI&apos;s harmful force. And, you know, the law does this in America with juries. We have juries. They deliberate, but they are protected in the types of information that they&apos;re allowed to hear or talk about or deliberate upon, because we know we need to protect them if they&apos;re to reach a judgment that is just. And democracy reformers, especially across Europe, are trying to do this right now. Reformers building citizen assemblies, across Europe mainly, in Japan as well. And the citizen assemblies are these random, representative, informed and deliberative bodies that take on particular democratic questions and address them in a way that could be protected from this corruption of the AI. So Iceland was able to craft a constitution out of a process like this. Ireland was able to approve gay marriage and deregulation of abortion through a process like this. France has addressed climate change and also end-of-life decisions. And across Germany there are many of these entities that are boiling up to find ways for a different democratic voice, to find voice. But here&apos;s the point. These are extraordinarily hopeful and exciting, no doubt. But they are not just a good idea. They are existential for democracy. They are security for democracy. They are a way to protect us from this AI hacking that steers against a public will. This is change not just to make democracy better, a tweak to just make it a little bit more democratic. It&apos;s a change to let democracy survive, given what we know technology will become. This is a terrifying moment. It&apos;s an exhilarating moment. Long before superintelligence, long before AGI threatens us, a different AI threatens us. But there is something to do while we still can do something. We should know enough now to know we can&apos;t trust democracy just now. We should see that we still have time to build something different. We should act with the love that makes anything possible, not because we know we will succeed. I&apos;m pretty sure we won&apos;t. But because this is what love means. You do whatever you can, whatever the odds, for your children, for your family, for your country, for humanity while there is still time, while our robot overlord is still just a sci-fi fantasy. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

If I look familiar to you, it&apos;s probably because at some point, you scrolled across one of my many goofy videos about fonts or AI or the planets or whatever. One of the nerdy sundries I&apos;ve put out there. I am a literature person by trade and by training, but I love to nerd out about science, and one of the questions that keeps me up at night is: What happened before the Big Bang? So I wrote a poem about it with an assist from science communicator Hank Green, who was talking about that very topic. And he sort of said in passing this line, which really struck me as simple but powerful. So I expanded it into this poem. Here it is. Before the Big Bang  there was no up there was no down there was no side to side there was no light there was no dark nor shape of any kind there were no stars or planet Mars or protons to collide there was no up there was no down there was no side to side and furthermore, to underscore this total lacking state there was no here there was no there because there was no space and in this endless void which can’t be thought of as a place there was no time and so no passing minutes, hours, days of all the paradoxes that belabor common sense I think this one’s the greatest this time before events because how did we get from nothing to infinitely dense from immeasurably small to inconceivably immense? but before we get unmoored from the question at the start let&apos;s take a breath and marvel at when math becomes an art because we don&apos;t have to comprehend it to know there was a time when there was no up there was no down there was no side to side Thank you. (Applause) Well, I just have one other thing I want to share with you before I go. And I&apos;m going to invite guitarist Toni Lindgren up here to join me for this. (Applause) This is a song I wrote about social media, where I spend so much of my time, and I think where so many of us spend maybe too much of our time. And I wrote this about kind of the endless scroll, and I think the conscious and unconscious desire that we all might have to reach out to other human beings and make connections in the digital void, even as we&apos;re sitting alone on our devices, in our homes. And I named the song &quot;Carl Sagan&quot; after the great astronomer and philosopher who saw the connections between ourselves and the billions and billions of stars in the night sky that are constantly sending out their light through the void to make contact. So this is &quot;Carl Sagan.&quot; (Guitar music) Hey, how are you? Are you scrolling alone inside your room? Is your heart good? Or did something go and break it? In the words of Carl Sagan, we&apos;re all just stars and bacon. That&apos;s not quite what he said, but it&apos;s true. Hey, you still here? Are you like me on this app so you can be lost and numb in a warm bath made of content, watching brilliant bits of nonsense because it feels like making contact. Maybe that&apos;s just me. How are you? And we are billions and billions of lights reaching out through a satellite just to know that feeling that even when we’re cold and on our own, we&apos;re not alone. Not alone. We are billions and billions of lights reaching out through a satellite just to know that feeling that even when we&apos;re cold and on our own, we&apos;re not alone. Not alone. And hey, are you all right? Are you scrolling alone again tonight? You&apos;ll be fine. Even if your heart is breaking. You got me and Carl Sagan and his famous postulation. That if we’re all alone in space, it’d be an awful waste. So I’m just signing in to say, how are you? (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)"
548464,carolyn_beans_how_do_heat_waves_affect_your_body,Carolyn Beans,How do heat waves affect your body?,https://www.ted.com/talks/carolyn_beans_how_do_heat_waves_affect_your_body,"The year is 2050 and your morning is not off to a good start. School is closed for yet another heat day, meaning the kids need to stay home and the AC needs to stay on. Your usual babysitter can’t come help because the rails for their commuter train were warped by the heat. And to make matters worse, your dog is desperate for a walk, but the pavement is hot enough to give third degree burns to any paw or person that touches it. In many parts of the world, this sweltering future is already here. On average, heat waves are happening more often with greater intensity and for longer durations.  But according to a 2022 projection, by 2050, Earth’s mid-latitudes could be experiencing extreme heat between 90 and 180 days a year, with tropical regions enduring even more. So, how hot is too hot, and what can people do to handle the heat? While human bodies are decent at managing temperature, our cooling mechanisms only work under the right conditions. When air temperatures climb, the hypothalamus tells blood vessels near the skin to widen, allowing more blood to flow near the body&apos;s surface and release heat. This hormonal cascade also turns on our sweat glands. As sweat evaporates, it pulls the heat from our skin. But if humidity is high, the rate of evaporation slows and eventually stops. Scientists use this principle to track humidity with a metric called wet-bulb temperature, in which they wrap a wet, room temperature cloth around a thermometer to see if evaporation will lower the reading. If it doesn&apos;t, it&apos;s too humid for sweat to cool us off. A wet-bulb temperature of roughly 35°C is generally considered the limit of human survival, though current temperatures rarely reach this threshold. The US National Weather Service uses the relationship between humidity and air temperature as the basis for their heat index. As those two metrics rise, so too does the heat index; and heat is considered dangerous  if the index climbs above 39.4°C. That’s 103°F. But even a lower heat index can be hazardous over multiple days. A heat wave is a streak of two or more days of unusually hot weather for a place and season.  For example, a string of 32°C days in Houston, Texas, is standard in the summer,  but would constitute a heat wave in March. And the impact of these events touches nearly every aspect of daily life. Imagine a June heat wave strikes a tropical city. The first to experience effects are outdoor workers. Their excessive sweating leads to dehydration and muscle pain known as heat cramps. If they push on, their conditions could worsen to heat exhaustion and even heat stroke— a life-threatening ailment that occurs when a body’s temperature exceeds 40°C. Medical emergency calls spike across the city, often for children and people who are pregnant or elderly. The heat also increases hospital visits for heart, kidney, and lung-related conditions, creating an influx of patients that threatens to overwhelm medical providers. Over the following week, the city slows to a crawl. Schools and construction sites close. Airplanes need to reduce their weight limits to take off, bumping countless travelers from their flights. Restaurants shut down as overheated kitchens become unbearable. Residents who remain inside with air conditioners stay safe. But blasting AC isn’t cheap, and many families have to choose between keeping cool and staying fed. Either way, if the heat continues, the stress of these air conditioners could overwhelm the power grid, potentially leading to city-wide outages. These consequences are all very real. Each year, close to 500,000 people die due to excessive heat, and these extreme conditions are only growing more common. We can limit medical impacts by seeking help for heat-related illnesses, staying hydrated,  and keeping people cool through public access to water and AC. But don’t let anyone tell you 1 to 2 degrees doesn’t matter. It will change our very way of life."
549283,malcolm_gladwell_the_tipping_point_i_got_wrong,Malcolm Gladwell,The tipping point I got wrong,https://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_the_tipping_point_i_got_wrong,"I want to tell you a story about when I moved to New York City in 1993. I was 30 years old, and I was moving to what was known as one of the most dangerous big cities in the United States. And every night, I would go out with my friends on a Friday or Saturday night, and at the end of every night we would have a little conference and we would pool all of our money, and we would figure out how everyone was going to get home, because you couldn&apos;t go home on the subway by yourself and you couldn&apos;t walk home, and if you were a woman, you definitely were not allowed to go home by yourself at one o&apos;clock in the morning on a Saturday night. That&apos;s what it meant to be in this very scary city called New York. I used to live in the sixth floor of a walk-up in the West Village, and my bedroom faced the fire escape. And even in the summer, I had no air conditioning, I had to keep my window closed because I was scared that somebody would come down the fire escape into my apartment. And then one day I woke up and I realized that I wasn&apos;t scared anymore. And I kept the window open. And I realized that when I was going out with my friends, we weren&apos;t having that conference at the end of the evening anymore. We were just going home. This city that I had thought, we all thought, was one of the scariest in the United States wasn&apos;t scary anymore. And I remember at the time I was absolutely transfixed by this transformation. I couldn&apos;t understand it. It was the same city full of the same weird, screwed up people, same buildings, same institutions. Only nobody was murdering each other anymore. And I would call up criminologists and I would ask them, &quot;What&apos;s your explanation?&quot; And no one could give me a good explanation. And I remember one day -- I used to go to the NYU, New York University has a library called Bobst Library. I used to go to Bobst to look for ideas. And I remember one day I was on the sixth floor in the sociology section, HM-1A6, and I was reading back issues, yes, I was, back issues of the American Journal of Sociology, and I ran across an article from 1991 by a guy named Jonathan Crane called “The Epidemic Theory of Ghetto Life.” And I&apos;m going to read to you how it began. &quot;The word epidemic is commonly used to describe the high incidence of social problems in ghettos. The news is filled with feature stories on crack epidemics, epidemics of gang violence, and epidemics of teenage childbearing. The term is used loosely in popular parlance, but turns out to be remarkably apt.&quot; And what Crane was saying is that if you look at these kinds of social problems, they behave, they come and they go, they rise and they fall exactly like viruses do. He was saying that that term epidemic is not a metaphor. It&apos;s a literal description. And I&apos;ll never forget when I read that little paragraph and I was standing in this aisle in Bobst Library, and, you know, it&apos;s a library. It&apos;s got that hush and that musty smell of books. And I&apos;m reading this crazy article from 1991, and I remember thinking to myself, oh my God, that&apos;s what happened in New York. We had an epidemic of crime. And what is the hallmark of an epidemic? It&apos;s the tipping point. It&apos;s the moment when the epidemic order goes up all at once or crashes all at once. And so I wrote an article for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine called &quot;The Tipping Point,&quot; which was my attempt to use this theory to explain what happened in New York. And then I, because of that article, got a contract for a book called &quot;The Tipping Point,&quot; which did very well. And that book led to another book and another book and another book. And I am standing here today because of that moment in the library 25 years ago. (Applause) So &quot;The Tipping Point,&quot; my first book, was about all kinds of things. I talked about Hush Puppies and Paul Revere and teenage smoking. But at the heart of it was a chapter on why did crime decline in New York. And in that chapter I talked a lot about a theory called broken windows theory, which was a very famous idea that had been pioneered by two criminologists called George Kelling and James Q. Wilson in the 1980s, very influential article, in which they argued that very small things in the environment can be triggers for larger crimes. That essentially small instances of disorder are tipping points for very serious things like murder or rape or any kind of violent crime. It was an epidemic theory of crime, and the New York City Police Department took that idea very seriously. And one of the things they began to do in the 1990s during this crime drop was to say what this argument means is that we can&apos;t be passive anymore. We have to be proactive. We have to go out there and if someone is jaywalking or jumping a turnstile or doing graffiti or peeing on the sidewalk, we&apos;ve got to stop them. And if we see a young man walking down the street and he looks a little bit suspicious, we&apos;ve got to stop him and frisk him for his weapons. That&apos;s how the NYPD interpreted the broken windows theory in New York. And my chapter was how millions of people around the world came to understand the crime drop in New York, that it was all broken windows. And here&apos;s the thing that I have come to understand about that explanation I gave of why crime fell in New York. I was wrong. I didn&apos;t understand this until quite recently, when I went back and I decided on the 25th anniversary of my first book, &quot;The Tipping Point,&quot; that I would write a sequel. It&apos;s called &quot;Revenge of the Tipping Point,&quot; and I went back and, for the first time in a quarter century, I reread my original book. I&apos;m not someone who likes to revisit things, but I did it, and it was a uniquely complicated experience. It was like looking back at your high school yearbook. You know, when you see yourself and you have some combination of, &quot;Wow, I look young,&quot; and also, &quot;Wow, I really wore that?&quot; It was like that. And what I realized is that in the intervening years since I wrote that explanation of why I think crime fell in New York, the theory of broken windows had been tested. There was a kind of classic natural experiment to see whether that theory worked. And the natural experiment was a court case, maybe one of the most famous court cases in New York history called Floyd v City of New York. It involved a young man named David Floyd, who had been stopped a number of occasions by the NYPD and was the face of a class action lawsuit that said the practice of stopping young men, largely young men of color, just because they look a little suspicious to police is not constitutional. You can&apos;t do that, right? And to everyone&apos;s surprise, the Floyd lawsuit goes before a federal judge. And the federal judge rules in David Floyd&apos;s favor. And overnight, the broken windows era in New York City policing ends. And the NYPD goes from -- In 2011, they stopped and frisked 700,000 young men, right. And after the Floyd lawsuit was decided in 2013, that number drops to less than 50,000. So this is the perfect natural experiment. You have New York before Floyd and New York after Floyd. Before Floyd, the principal tactic of the NYPD is stopping everyone they can. And after Floyd that goes away. They can&apos;t do that anymore, right? This is the perfect test case for whether you think that&apos;s why crime fell in New York. And if you believe in the power of broken windows policing, then your expectation has to be that after the Floyd case, when broken windows goes away, crime is going to go back up, right? And I should tell you that in 2013, in the wake of the Floyd case, everybody thought crime was going to go back up. The NYPD thought that, the city government thought that, the pundits thought that, even the judge who wrote the opinion saying that stop and frisk was unconstitutional, said in her opinion that she strongly suspected that as a result of this opinion, crime would go back up. I thought crime was going to go back up, right? All of us had internalized the logic of broken windows. We said, yes, we know this strategy poses an incredible burden on young men, but what choice do we have, right? You know, if the choice is being stopped repeatedly by police or being killed, maybe we&apos;re better off with the former than the latter. This is the price we pay for a safe New York, right? So what happens after the Floyd case? Stop and frisk goes away and crime falls. In fact, crime in New York City undergoes a second, even more miraculous decline, right? And what&apos;s interesting about this is, you know, when the first crime declined in the 1990s, you see that decline almost everywhere in the United States, not quite as steep as New York, but crime goes down everywhere. And then in every other city in the United States, crime plateaus. But New York gets rid of broken windows, and crime starts to fall and fall and fall all over again. To the point by 2019 that New York City is as safe as Paris, which is not a sentence I ever thought anyone would ever say in my lifetime. And what we realize in that second crime decline is that it wasn&apos;t broken windows. It&apos;s not indiscriminate policing that causes crime to fall. Rather, it is the intelligent and thoughtful and selective application of police authority that causes crime to fall. Now, there&apos;s a couple of really puzzling things here. One is that people don&apos;t seem to have internalized the fact that New York underwent this second, even more dramatic crime fall. People still act like it&apos;s the year 2000 when it comes to making sense of New York. You know, a whole bunch of very, very wealthy hedge fund guys have very loudly left New York for Miami in recent years. And they all say, when they&apos;re packing up their offices in New York, &quot;We can&apos;t take the crime anymore.&quot; Well, violent crime in Miami is twice as high as New York City. If they were really concerned about violent crime, they would leave Coral Gables before they get murdered and move to the Bronx, where it is a whole lot safer. (Laughter) (Applause) The other even more important thing, though, is that people act like stop and frisk actually worked. No one seems to have internalized the lesson of the great Floyd case natural experiment. If you listen to people -- I&apos;m not going to name their names, but people going around the country now campaigning for higher office, they will say things like, &quot;It&apos;s time to bring back stop and frisk and broken windows policing. It worked so well in New York.&quot; They&apos;re acting as if we didn&apos;t have that great moment of understanding in 2013. And for that, for that misunderstanding, I think I bear some of the blame. I was the one who wrote this book saying this was the greatest tactic ever in stopping crime. Now, how do I make sense of my mistake? Well, I can give you all kinds of excuses. You know, I can say I&apos;m not a fortune teller. I didn&apos;t know that David Floyd was going to come along 10 years after I wrote my book and give us this great test case in broken windows policing. You know, I could say that, you know, I was just writing what everybody believed back in the 1996 and 1997. But I don&apos;t think those excuses hold any water whatsoever. I think that journalists, writers need to be held to a higher standard, right? I wrote -- (Applause) I told a story about how crime fell in New York, and I told the story like the story was over. And like I knew what the answer to this story was. And it wasn&apos;t over and I didn&apos;t know the answer, right? I wrote, &quot;I know this is what happened,&quot; and what I should have said is &quot;This is what I believe happened now,&quot; right? And those words &quot;I believe happened now&quot; have to be at the center of any understanding of how the world works. We have to acknowledge that we are representing the position of this very moment, and that that position could change if the facts change, right? The great desire of any writer is to write a book for the ages, that will forever explain the way things are, but that&apos;s not possible, and no one should ever try. That was my mistake. And I&apos;m sorry. (Applause) Monique Ruff-Bell: That was some mea culpa, Malcolm. And so I have a couple of questions for you. If you don&apos;t mind, I want to take you back 25 years to that version of yourself. And so you talked about how there was a sense of anxiety and fear about what crime was happening around that time. I grew up in New York around that time, 25 years ago. Being in my early 20s and having these experiences with my friends where they experienced unfortunate instances with stop and frisk, so much so they had anxiety, hurt and fear. And so when you were thinking about this and the support, did you ever think about what if they got it wrong, what if it was wrong and innocent people were going to have to experience this? What were your thoughts about that back then? Malcolm Gladwell: Well, I wasn&apos;t thinking about that. I mean, it&apos;s funny, I went, when I was sort of trying to figure out what I did wrong in that chapter, I went down to Philadelphia and I went and met with a group of doctors, all of them Black, at University of Pennsylvania, because they had done some really interesting work on crime, and I wanted to get their sense. And one of the doctors had read that chapter on crime. And she said, &quot;You know, when I read your chapter on crime, you were exceedingly interested --&quot; I opened that chapter with the famous story of Bernie Goetz, the guy who shot the kids on the subway. And she said, &quot;Go back and reread the way you wrote that story, and you&apos;ll realize you spent a lot of time talking about the fear of the white guy, and you have two sentences on the kids. And the kids were every bit as damaged as the guy who shot them.&quot; And I realized, I think I was just in -- like so many of us, I was in a little bubble, and I was seeing the problem from one perspective. And like many, you know, middle- and upper-class professionals in Manhattan, I wasn&apos;t thinking about the world through the eyes of someone in the Bronx or Brooklyn. And some of that has to do with youth, and some of that has to do with foolishness. And I&apos;d like to think I&apos;m a little wiser now. MRB: Right. So you had a quote -- (Applause) &quot;I told this story like I knew the answer and it wasn&apos;t over.&quot; How has that insight affected your thinking and your writing now? MG: I&apos;ve tried to be, I mean, I realize when I look back at my younger self, I was way too certain about the ideas that I was putting forth. And I thought that if you wanted to win over an audience, you had to communicate certainty. And now I realize that&apos;s actually backwards, that you&apos;re more willing, you&apos;re more capable of winning over an audience when you admit to the uncertainty and the fragility of your position. People want that. They like that, they appreciate that spirit far more. And people are much more likely, I think, to be suspicious of someone who seems falsely certain. MRB: Well, we appreciate you bringing your thoughts to this platform and sharing that. And so thank you to Malcolm Gladwell for doing that. (Applause)"

548286,kiah_williams_3_reasons_why_medications_are_so_expensive_in_the_us,Kiah Williams,3 reasons why medications are so expensive in the US,https://www.ted.com/talks/kiah_williams_3_reasons_why_medications_are_so_expensive_in_the_us,"After helping develop the first insulin therapy in 1921, Canadian physician Frederick Banting transferred his patent rights to the University of Toronto for $1, stating that insulin belonged to the world— not to him. A century later, insulin medications remain essential in treating diabetes, and have relatively low production costs, with a vial generally costing less than $6 to make. But how much it costs a patient to buy varies greatly by country. Those in the US may pay thousands for insulin annually— on average 10 times more than those in many other countries— leading some patients to take less than prescribed. And this is part of a much larger trend. Let’s take a look at the US drug supply chain to understand why. First, there’s research and development, which ranges widely in cost, depending on the drug. Expenses incurred by the many drugs that don’t make it to market also need to be factored in here. And almost every approved drug has been subsidized by taxes. Before pharmaceutical companies actually release a drug, they set its price. Historically, they haven&apos;t been required to justify the pricing they land on. Pharmaceutical companies are also allowed terms of drug patent protection and exclusivity rights that prevent other manufacturers from launching identical drugs for a set period of time. Once patents expire, competition usually causes prices to drop, so some companies invest heavily to extend their patents. They may make tweaks— like small changes in dosage and modes of delivery— to obtain new patents and sue competitors  into delaying the release of similar drugs. The companies responsible for Humira, the best-selling autoimmune drug, for example, have defended its patents and raised its price 27 times since 2003. Without insurance, it can cost over $96,000 a year. And as three pharmaceutical companies have dominated the insulin market with similar tactics, average insulin list prices have tripled over the last two decades. Once a drug is approved, there are two main distribution channels it can take: the retail route includes drugs you pick up at pharmacies; the other consists of drugs administered at hospitals and clinics. This includes many of the more expensive, research-intensive therapies for rare conditions. Each channel involves unique businesses. Most drugs— including insulin— follow the retail channel. It starts with a pharmaceutical company selling the drug to wholesalers, which buy in bulk and sell to pharmacies, which sell to patients. But the US doesn&apos;t provide universal health care, so many Americans use health insurance. When an insured patient picks up their prescription, they often pay a portion while the pharmacy bills their insurer the rest. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, which are companies unique to the US market, negotiate on behalf of insurers to get discounts from manufacturers in exchange for insurance coverage. PBMs may pass some of the negotiated discount to insurers— but they may also take a considerable portion. Their role tends to limit patient choice, and they’ve sometimes covered more expensive branded drugs instead of cheaper generics because it earns them a greater profit. Without insurance, patients may be expected to foot the bill entirely, at non-negotiated rates. Money flows between the different businesses as fees, rebates, discounts, and copay assistance.  If it feels hard to follow, that&apos;s because it is. And it&apos;s tough to know exactly how much money goes where because these transactions lack transparency. But for insulin in 2018, of all that was spent on the medication: manufacturers received about 46%; wholesalers got about 8%; pharmacies, 20%; insurance companies, 10%; and PBMs, 14%. Interestingly, as insulin list prices increased between 2014 and 2018, the amount manufacturers retained decreased, and more than half went to intermediaries. Where the US has businesses negotiate at various steps, other countries generally have government agencies evaluate a drug’s benefit, make bulk purchases, and regulate pricing. The US sees the most drug development— and profit— of any country. But about 1 in 4 Americans reported trouble affording prescriptions in 2019. Many experts have called for measures like increased regulation in drug pricing, patenting, and intermediary profits, along with more national health and research funding. This way, the US could ideally lower prices and encourage more innovative, lifesaving drug development. And by making medications affordable, pharmaceutical companies could theoretically maintain profits. In 2023, one of the largest insulin manufacturers announced it would substantially decrease the drug’s list price, and two others followed suit. This should make insulin more affordable. But system-wide changes would have to be instated to make sure patients are getting the medications they need."
549352,franziska_trautmann_your_empty_wine_bottle_could_help_rebuild_coastlines,Franziska Trautmann,Your empty wine bottle could help rebuild coastlines,https://www.ted.com/talks/franziska_trautmann_your_empty_wine_bottle_could_help_rebuild_coastlines,"As a kid growing up on a Louisiana bayou, the boogeyman was the existential threat of my state being washed away with the Mississippi River. Louisiana loses a football field&apos;s worth of land every 100 minutes due to coastal erosion. It&apos;s an unimaginably large amount to a kid. But in my lifetime so far, we&apos;ve lost over 600 square miles. That&apos;s more area than New York City, San Francisco, DC and Atlanta combined. It&apos;s due to sea level rise, warming waters, increasingly severe storms and exploration of the oil and gas industry. Fast forward to 2020, in my last full semester as an engineering student and over a Two-Buck Chuck, my boyfriend and I lamented over the lack of glass recycling in Louisiana. My state was landfilling about 295 million pounds of glass annually. The bottle we just finished would likely end up in a landfill. It felt like a total waste, and we wanted to figure out how we could get all of this glass recycled. The next day, it took a quick Google search to remember that glass comes from sand, and that sand is an increasingly finite resource. We also learned about everything sand is needed for, including toothpaste, by the way. And the last puzzle piece we found was this small, human-sized machine that could crush one bottle at a time into sand, and we jumped into action, setting up a GoFundMe campaign and a pilot project in the backyard of a fraternity house. (Laughter) Now you might be thinking to yourself, how in the world would two college kids ever be able to make a dent in these problems? And that would be valid. Plenty of people told us the exact same thing. But we didn’t listen, because we knew that no matter how small of an impact we made, it would be worth it. It felt like we could alleviate two problems with one solution: convert the otherwise landfilled glass back into sand and use it in restoration projects across the state. Easy, right? (Laughs) But we didn&apos;t listen to the haters, which is actually why we named our company Glass Half Full. (Laughter) But that glass-half-empty mindset might actually be one of the biggest threats we face today. Because climate apathy might be the new climate denial. Meaning that the biggest threat to our environment may no longer be people who deny our part in the changing climate but people who deny that we can actually make a difference. Now climate change is happening right before our eyes. It&apos;s terrifying. I&apos;ve witnessed firsthand the severity of rapidly intensifying hurricanes like Ida. But dread, doom and gloom tend to get us nowhere. Whereas hope, combined with action, can be one of the most powerful tools to enact change. (Applause) Since that late night wine-fueled idea over four years ago, we&apos;ve been able to divert more than eight million pounds of glass from our landfills. Thank you. (Cheers and applause) We quickly grew out of that small, tiny machine and upgraded a lot along the way. We continue to work with over 50 scientists and engineers across the Gulf South. And they helped me learn if this is good-smelling mud or not. But also understanding the interactions of our sand with the plants, animals and even fungi of our region. We&apos;ve also answered difficult scientific questions as well as questions like, can you actually walk on sand made from glass? And I exposed my toes to the internet to answer that. In a few short months, we&apos;ll be opening up our new facility, enabling us to recycle the 295 million pounds of glass entering our landfills annually. (Cheers and applause) And with a combination of biodegradable sandbags and native marsh grasses, we&apos;ve already restored thousands of square meters along our coast, converting open water back into thriving wetlands. (Cheers and applause) But the key to our success so far isn’t that we had all of the answers in the beginning or tons of money to try this thing out. The key was that we simply started, and we kept going. Somewhere, the belief that we, as individuals, could enact change trumped our doubts. And for us, finding a way to help with a problem much, much bigger than us meant taking that first step. And in our case, it was a step in the sand, in an eroding but once magnificent swamp. Thank y’all. (Cheers and applause)"
548271,daniel_hallak_networking_doesn_t_have_to_feel_gross,Daniel Hallak,Networking doesn't have to feel gross,https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_hallak_networking_doesn_t_have_to_feel_gross,"When I was in graduate school, there was a student who I looked up to. His name was Peter. Peter was the type of person you wanted to be like. He was smart, articulate and winsome. One day I saw Peter in the library. It was his final quarter in our program and he was about to graduate. &quot;Peter, congratulations. You must be so excited.&quot; His response surprised me. &quot;I am, but I haven&apos;t built my network like I should have, so I don&apos;t have any jobs lined up yet.&quot; His answer terrified me. If someone as impressive as Peter didn&apos;t have a job lined up, then what was I to do? As the son of two immigrants, education was the key to success. I could not afford to waste this opportunity. I found myself feeling anxious and fearful. I had to find a way to protect my career. The stakes were too high for me to finish school without having a job lined up. Then I remembered the advice I&apos;d been given countless times. Go network. Build relationships. After all, it&apos;s all about who you know, not what you know. They were right. Education wasn&apos;t the highway of opportunity. It was merely an on ramp. The highway of opportunity was social capital. Your network, the people you know, and more importantly, the people who know you. I was determined. I set off to build a network that would guarantee my success. I spent as much time as I could building relationships with people who could hire me when I graduated. The process worked. But it didn&apos;t feel right. I was having the right conversations, I was meeting the right people. Internship and job opportunities began to open up, but networking and building relationships began to feel gross. I was approaching people as a transactional consumer, not as a relational investor. My driving question was focused on what can I get from this person? How can they help me? I was asking the wrong questions. Networking was a necessary evil. It felt gross. Then one day, the tables were turned. I saw a childhood acquaintance at a coffee shop. We started a conversation. He then spent the entire time trying to convince me to join the multi-level marketing scheme that he was a part of. (Laughter) You see, the more people he signed up underneath him, the more money he would make. But that&apos;s not all. He&apos;d help me build an empire as well. In fact, I could make so much money, I would never need to work again. I could give to my parents for all that they had given to me, and all by simply helping people change their spending habits and just begin to buy products from us, products that they were already going to buy on their own anyways. It was at that moment that I began to realize, if networking ever feels gross, you&apos;re doing it wrong. It turns out that social scientists had studied what I&apos;ve experienced. In 2014, researchers from the University of Toronto, Harvard and Northeastern teamed up to investigate the impact of building social capital on people&apos;s sense of morality. What they discovered across their work was that when people built relationships for selfish pursuits, it left them feeling psychologically dirty and even morally stained. Decades of research confirms the common advice about networking. Building social capital leads to a host of positive outcomes: job performance, salary levels, employability and so much more. If you want to build your career or your business, then networking is a good strategy. But here&apos;s the dilemma. When people built relationships for selfish gain, it left them feeling dirty. And when they felt dirty, they were even less likely to engage with those people and to build those relationships. Even though that might be exactly what they needed for their success in their careers. There&apos;s a reason that I felt gross when I was approaching people as a transactional consumer, instead of as a relational investor. How do you do relationships in a way that you don&apos;t feel like you need to rinse off after every coffee meeting? I began to ask a different question. Instead of &quot;What can I get from this person?&quot; I began to ask, &quot;What can I give to this person?&quot; Everything changed. I discovered generous relational investors who introduced me to a different paradigm, a new way of doing relationships. Jeff, a business leader in Seattle, was one of them. If you ever sit with him for coffee, you quickly realize his goal is to understand how he can serve you, not how you can serve him. This new mindset moved me from being a greedy, transactional consumer to being a generous relational investor. Relational investors leave people better than they found them. The goal isn’t giving to gain or even about paying it forward so that positive things circle back around for you one day. Relational investors give out of the overflow of who they are and what they&apos;ve already been given. They bring generosity beyond reciprocity. They ask a different question. Instead of &quot;What can I get from this person?&quot; They ask, &quot;What can I give to this person?&quot; It represents a mindset shift from fixating on pathology to focusing on potential. The human default is pathology. Pathology is all about the barriers, the obstacles, the brokenness, the things that are going wrong. My PhD is in industrial and organizational psychology. For decades, psychology and many other human-centered disciplines have focused on pathology. What&apos;s broken? How do we fix it? Over the last 30 years, there&apos;s been a revolution that&apos;s pushed against pathology, though, and begun to look for potential. What&apos;s working? What&apos;s going well? How do we make things even better? It&apos;s a shift from scarcity to abundance. And it starts with the assumption that there is possibility, and there is potential to be realized. Both are important. We have to pay attention to barriers and limitations, but we also need to recognize possibility and potential. But our baseline is self-preservation. Protect my career. Position myself for success. When I became free from the fear of finding a job, I was able to move from protecting my pathology to looking for potential. As the old saying goes, it&apos;s even better to give than it is to receive. And you don&apos;t have to be wealthy to be a relational investor. I was a poor student. I discovered that generous relational investors give their time, their treasure and their talent. Generosity looks different in different seasons of life. It could be as simple as the gift of your undivided attention. The next time you&apos;re meeting with somebody. Or maybe it&apos;s a heartfelt thank-you note, letting someone know you&apos;ve appreciated how they have invested in you. Perhaps it&apos;s a timely introduction. You&apos;ve built a relationship with somebody and you know somebody else who would be mutually beneficial for them to meet. So you make that connection. Generosity could even look like helping a coworker who&apos;s behind on a deadline. Taking a little extra time to help them get caught up. It could even be as simple as the offer to review someone&apos;s resume for them. The possibilities for generosity are only limited by your imagination. Because people aren&apos;t a process. People are the purpose. And business is all about people. It&apos;s not about extracting value or leveraging relationships. It’s about building meaningful, generous and mutually beneficial relationships, looking for ways to serve other people, even if they are the ones who are helping you. You might not get anything back right away, or even at all. But there&apos;s still value in the relationship because every person has inherent dignity, value and worth, regardless of the outcome. Years after my conversation with Peter in the library, I found myself working in a university helping lead a graduate business program. I was meeting with a prospective student to learn about his goals. He was a great candidate and I really wanted him in our program. But over the course of the conversation, I began to realize what he was looking for wasn&apos;t quite what I had to offer. Reluctantly, I pointed him in a different direction. A year later, I had another similar conversation with a young woman who was also exploring our program. She was incredible. Her goals aligned with our training and she became one of our best students. But it wasn&apos;t until after she started when I discovered she had found out about our program from the young man I&apos;d met over a year before. He had told her if she met with me, I&apos;d put her interests first. And that if she wasn&apos;t the right fit, I&apos;d point her in the right direction. Focusing on the interests of other people can absolutely pay off for the long term. But that&apos;s not the point. There is nothing more rewarding than giving to other people. My parents, they impressed the value of education on me, but they also demonstrated the value of generosity. They have been avid suburban gardeners for over 40 years. They started composting in Seattle before composting was the thing to do. Every year I have watched them till the ground, fertilize, prepare and plant seeds, water them and care for their garden with great intent. They do such an excellent job that every year, they harvest so much produce, there&apos;s absolutely no way they can possibly consume it all themselves. They have so much that it will go to spoil. It will go to waste. So what do they do? Instead of letting it go to spoil, they spoil their friends. They take all the excess. They put it in bags and baskets, and they generously share it with all of their friends and neighbors. Most years, they even take their extra seeds to help friends start their own gardens for the following year. Looking back, I realize, my parents didn&apos;t garden just for themselves. Don&apos;t get me wrong, they enjoyed the fresh fruit and produce, but they had equal, if not greater, joy in giving to the people around them. The relationships in their lives represented a place for giving, not a vehicle for getting. They showed me that you can get more than you give by giving more than you get. Our networks, our relationships are also like a garden. If we tend them well, they will grow and they will produce fruit. So much, in fact, there&apos;s absolutely no way we can possibly consume it all ourselves. Instead of letting relationships go to waste, we can invest in them, give to them, serve them, connect them with each other. When we give social capital, we don&apos;t lose it. It doesn&apos;t decrease. It increases. Who knows, we might even help someone start their own garden. Becoming a generous relational investor, it&apos;s a lifestyle. It&apos;s a different paradigm of relationships. So what&apos;s your relational posture? Are you a greedy, transactional consumer or a generous relational investor? Are you protecting your pathology or pushing for potential? It&apos;s never too late to begin to ask a different question and to start to look for what can I give, not what can I get? (Applause)"
547664,alex_rosenthal_the_dungeon_master_s_riddle,Alex Rosenthal,The dungeon master's riddle,https://www.ted.com/talks/alex_rosenthal_the_dungeon_master_s_riddle,"It’s a Monday, which means yet another party of adventurers has broken into your lair, here to slay your minions and steal your treasures. Judging by the trail of destruction, you’re up against a fighter, a rogue, and a cleric. The first two won’t be a problem for a powerful necromancer like you, but the cleric’s spells are trouble. If they can cast even one on you, you’re a goner. Which is why it&apos;s lucky that the party has fallen prey to one of your traps. In order to enter your inner sanctum, each adventurer had to drink either a truth or lying potion. Then, foolishly, one picked up a cursed skull which immobilized all three adventurers’ limbs for 10 minutes or until you physically interact with one of them. You rush to the scene bearing a magical ring that can render a cleric harmless and have no idea which adventurer is which.  Well, that’s okay— the potions they drank will compel each to answer one question  with either the truth or a lie. You demand, “which one of you is the cleric?” Agan answers: Beorn is not both a lying-potion drinker and a cleric. Beorn says, either Agan drank a lying-potion or I am not a cleric. And Cedar replies, the cleric drank a lying potion. Quick! Who is the cleric?  Answer in 3 Answer in 2  Answer in 1 In order to find the cleric in this puzzle, originally crafted by master logician Raymond Smullyan, we’ll need to also figure out who drank what. There are several paths to the solution, but Cedar’s statement is more straightforward than the other two, so let’s start there. If Cedar’s telling the truth, she can’t be the cleric, since then the cleric would also have to be a liar. But if she’s lying, she also can’t be the cleric, because then the cleric should have told the truth. So the cleric must be Agan or Beorn. Let’s assume that Cedar is telling the truth, meaning the cleric is lying. If Agan is also telling the truth, Beorn must be the lying cleric by the process of elimination. But Agan’s statement contradicts this by saying that Beorn can’t be both lying and a cleric, leaving no possible cleric.  If, on the other hand, Agan is lying, then her statement means Beorn is a lying cleric. Now we need to look at Bjorn’s sentence. And this is where things get tricky, because the way it’s structured, it can be confusing understanding what a lie would be. So let&apos;s simplify. Beorn stated two facts, and said that exactly one of them is true. So if Beorn is telling the truth, it could be that 1 is true and 2 is false, or 1 is false and 2 is true. And if Beorn is lying, it means that 1 and 2 are both true or both false. This is equivalent to the XOR, or exclusive OR, function in Boolean algebra, a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations. Boolean algebra is the underpinning of the electronic logic gates that allow computers to function, using 1′s and 0′s instead of true and false. So now let’s assess Beorn’s statement based on what we know. We’re assuming that Agan is a liar, making 1 true and 2 false— because Beorn would be the cleric. But in that case, Beorn would be telling the truth, which contradicts the idea that the cleric is a liar. In other words, if Cedar is telling the truth, Agan can&apos;t be telling the truth or lying.  Therefore, Cedar must be lying, so the cleric is telling the truth. So again, let’s consider the possibilities for Agan. She can’t be lying, because then Beorn would be a lying cleric, which we know isn&apos;t possible.  So Agan must be telling the truth, and we’re back to our truth table for Beorn. Statement 1 is false. And if the second were false, Beorn would be a lying cleric; again, impossible. So statement 2 is true, making both Agan and Beorn truthtellers, and Agan the cleric. You slide the ring onto her finger, polymorph all three into skeletal mice— temporarily, of course, you’re not a monster— and send them on their merry way. But in that moment, was there a... connection?"

If you have an AI system that helps us understand mathematics, you can solve the economy of the world. If you have an AI system that can understand humanitarian sciences, we can actually solve all of our conflicts. I want this system to, given Einstein’s and Maxwell’s equations, take it and solve new physics, you know. If you understand physics, you can solve the energy problem. So you can actually design ways for humans to be the better versions of themselves. I&apos;m Ramin Hasani. I’m the cofounder and CEO of Liquid AI. Liquid AI is an AI company built on top of a technology that I invented back at MIT. It’s called “liquid neural networks.” These are a form of flexible intelligence, as opposed to today&apos;s AI systems that are fixed, basically. So think about your brain. You can change your thoughts. When somebody talks to you, you can completely change the way you respond. You always have a mechanism that we call feedback in your system. So basically when you receive information from someone as an input, you basically process that information, and then you reply. For liquid neural networks, we simply got those feedback mechanisms, and we added that to the system. So that means it has the ability of thinking. That property is inspired by nature. We looked into brains of animals and, in particular, a very, very tiny worm called “C. elegans” The fascinating fact about the brain of the worm is that it shares 75 percent of the genome that it has with humans. We have the entire genome mapped. So we understand a whole lot about the functionality of its nervous system as well. So if you understand the properties of cells in the worm, maybe we can build intelligent systems that are as good as the worm and then evolve them into systems that are better than even humans. The reason why we are studying nature is the fact that we can actually, having a shortcut through exploring all the possible kind of algorithms that you can design. You can look into nature, that would give you like, a shortcut to really faster get into efficient algorithms because nature has done a lot of search, billions of years of evolution, right? So we learned so much from those principles. I just brought a tiny principle from the worm into artificial neural networks. And now they are flexible, and they can solve problems in an explainable way that was not possible before. AI is becoming very capable, right? The reason why AI is hard to regulate is because we cannot understand, even the people who design the systems, we don&apos;t understand those systems. They are black boxes. With Liquid, because we are fundamentally using mathematics that are understandable, we have tools to really understand and pinpoint which part of the system is responsible for what, you&apos;re designing white box systems. So if you have systems that you can understand their behavior, that means even if you scale them into something very, very intelligent, you can always have a lot of control over that system because you understand it. You can never let it go rogue. So all of the crises we are dealing with right now, you know, doomsday kind of scenarios, is all about scaling a technology that we don&apos;t understand. With Liquid, our purpose is to really calm people down and show people that, hey, you can have very powerful systems, that you have a lot of control and visibility into their working mechanisms. The gift of having something [with] superintelligence is massive, and it can enable a lot of things for us. But at the same time, we need to have control over that technology. Because this is the first time that we’re going to have a technology that is going to be better than all of humanity combined."

Well, last year, I was asked by the United Arab Emirates, the country that was in charge of the climate negotiations, to help deliver a significant progress in the connection between food and climate. My name is Gonzalo Muñoz, I&apos;m a farmer from Chile, and definitely, it&apos;s a pleasure to be with all of you here today. So back in the farm, I&apos;ve been dealing with water scarcity for the last 15 years. We&apos;ve seen firsthand how much climate change is affecting and reducing our capacity to produce, as well as how much our conventional practices are contributing to the problem. That, of course, inspired us to innovate. So, for example, producing the best 2023 Chilean Syrah with only one liter of water, instead of an average of 240 liters as a normal practice in the region where we are. I also got very much involved in the global promotion of circular economy, as well as with certification standards for companies that meet the highest performance and social and environmental practices, so-called B Corps. Probably because of that, in 2019, the Chilean government invited me to serve as the United Nations High-Level Climate Action Champion. And in that role, I had to mobilize all non-state actors. Of course, companies like mine, but as well as cities, some national governments, financial institutions, civil society, anyone that can deliver concrete action on the ground, and through that, push for governments, for them also to take bolder action on climate. But there, I noticed that there was something missing. The broader food system, from the way we produce, distribute, consume, even the way we&apos;re wasting our food, has a huge impact in the climate crisis. As you all probably know, food and agriculture are really complex topics. I bet we won&apos;t find two people in this room that have exactly the same understanding and relationship with food, whether it&apos;s because of health reasons, or it can be because of ideology, or religion, or culture, or even because of taste. Well, same thing happens with countries. For some countries, the number one priority is food security, whereas some communities deeply rely on agricultural commodities like cotton, or beef or soy. So part of the problem as well is that the food system nowadays is not fit for purpose. At this precise moment in history, there are around 800 million of hungry people. And at the same time, we&apos;re wasting and losing about one-third of the food production. Our food system is both causing climate change and being severely affected by the climate crisis. Of course, it&apos;s also a system confronting many different challenges, like a pandemic, right? Or conflicts, or disrupted supply chains or droughts, all types of shocks and stresses. So at this point, you can imagine that food and agriculture are really political topics, right? And of course, we can no longer delay. So I have some news to share with all of you. In 2023, led by the United Arab Emirates, and with the help of so many brilliant people, some of whom are here in the room, we tried a new approach, and that means that we work with the UAE Food and Agriculture Declaration to ensure the highest political recognition that food must move from being a source of pollution and degradation to become one of the most important tools for climate action, benefiting both people and the planet. Well, have you any of you tried ever to agree with your neighbors on something like, whatever, paint the communal walls and decide the color? (Laughter) Hard, right? Well, try to agree on food and agriculture with 200 countries. (Laughter) Yeah, wish you luck. When we started this plan, we set ourselves a goal of &quot;Let&apos;s try to put together 100 heads of state signing the UAE Declaration. At the end, we not have only 100, but 159 heads of state signing the UAE Declaration on Food and Agriculture. That and counting. That is absolutely -- (Cheers and applause) Thank you. That is massive, and honestly, absolutely unprecedented. How we did it and most importantly, how can we accelerate progress? First, focus on people building the resilience of food producers, farmers, fisherfolks, anyone that is producing our food, for those people to thrive despite the climate crisis and become real, effective stewards of nature. Second, set a goal, but not prescribe how to get there. Every country is facing different circumstances. We have to respect that, and allow every country to design their pathway, and of course, ask them to set precise goals and targets. Third, we need, of course, to reflect on the diversity and complexity of food systems. Every region has a different starting point. On the other side, during this process, real economy actors started to discuss what a food system non-state actors called to action could look like. So with the leadership of the high-level champions, and building on several experiences that happened before, we started to get a very careful consultation process, with many stakeholders from all around the world, from smallholder farmers to big, multinational corporations on food, from Indigenous communities to commercial banks, to concretely have a common vision and a set of ten priority goals to ensure climate action. Amazingly, more than 1,000 groups of non-state actors endorsed the call to action, and with more and more endorsing every day, as we continue rallying them towards the next cycle of negotiations. So suddenly, we were in front of what we can call, potentially, an ambition loop. It&apos;s a positive, virtuous loop between states and non-state actors. When countries strongly agree on something, they send a message to the real economy, where some non-state actors immediately react by raising the bar, with concrete examples. That act of leadership, proving that it can be done, immediately sends back the message to the politicians, encouraging them for also raising the bar through policymaking. That&apos;s what we triggered in the run up and during the negotiations in Dubai. So now, we have these two pledges. It&apos;s great, but it&apos;s not enough. We know that. And many of us, many here in the room and myself, have a mission to continue to mobilize action as we envision this next cycle of negotiations towards 2025, in Brazil and beyond. There will be many, many things that are needed, right? But let me refer to a few of them that come to my mind as critical. First, we have to stop damaging nature. Our food system depends and relies on functional and healthy ecosystems and resources. Second, we need to scale all forms of finance for the transition towards a sustainable food system, but at the same time for innovating, changing the incentives, and at the same time, for securing a just transition for everyone. We also need to develop all types of metrics, goals and targets for countries to own them so we can also hold governments to account when we measure progress. Of course, we will need much more than that, but just with that, we can start envisioning the start of this new ambition loop, just like we had in the previous decades, with renewable energy. And of course, I have my ambition loop in my farm, too. We will continue working on innovating on practices for reducing the need of water, we will continue working on regeneration, with endangered species. We will continue using renewable energy. And let&apos;s imagine what happens when those practices are packed, and therefore scaled up to the size of a country like Chile, and you have more and more farmers, more and more businesses, more and more value chains adopting those practices. All of a sudden, we can have a global food system that is fit for purpose, nourishing everyone while restoring the earth. That&apos;s the ambition loop I want to see. Muchas gracias. (Cheers and applause)"
546537,cliff_kapono_and_keolu_fox_could_we_replace_data_centers_with_plant_dna,Cliff Kapono and Keolu Fox,Could we replace data centers with … plant DNA?,https://www.ted.com/talks/cliff_kapono_and_keolu_fox_could_we_replace_data_centers_with_plant_dna,"Cliff Kapono: So people are pretty surprised when I tell them I know the world&apos;s first native Hawaiian genome scientist. Not because of all the texts he sends me about genome editing and DNA research, but mostly because they&apos;re dominated by cat memes. Keolu Fox: Oh, brother, you know there&apos;s plenty of surfing in there, too. CK: That&apos;s true. Those take up their own folder. KF: There&apos;s something you should know about Cliff and I. We&apos;ve known each other forever, and we spend way too much time staring at our phones, looking at surf videos. CK: He&apos;s one of those screen time people. You know, FaceTime only, won&apos;t answer the phone unless he&apos;s giving us face-to-face. And if he is texting me, he&apos;s asking me to send him updates on what the waves look like or how the waves were. KF: That&apos;s true. I love FaceTime, but that&apos;s because Cliff here is unique. As the only professional surfer to have a PhD in analytical chemistry, no less, he gets to spend his time exploring and surfing some of the most incredible waves on the planet. And now that we have the capacity to share that information from anywhere in the world, why wouldn&apos;t we? CK: Probably because it&apos;s using up all my monthly data, sending him images of what the waves look like whenever I&apos;m on a surf trip. KF: That brings up a good point. We do share and interact with terabytes of data almost every day, some more than others. CK: Through texts, emails, and now this thing -- I don&apos;t know if you guys heard about AI -- we&apos;re entering a new phase of data production, consumption, and probably one of the most challenging issues of our generation -- data storage. KF: But we think we have a solution. And the answer is an Indigenous one. We believe we can package text, images and even surf videos in the genomes of living organisms and access them at a later time. CK: Because, as Keolu likes to remind me, what&apos;s a genome if not a giant hard drive? Our difference is we want to put this information into local plants, sequestering atmospheric CO2, and also reducing the energy required in a rapidly changing climate. KF: You see, the climate crisis has a new problem. Data centers are rapidly contributing to this climate crisis. And data forecasters estimate that by next year, there will be over 50 billion IoT devices connected to one another, generating over 80 billion terabytes of information. And to put things into context, that new iPhone in your pocket, that can hold a total of around one terabyte of information. CK: But we&apos;re not just storing information on our phones anymore. We&apos;re uploading them onto that cloud, wherever it is. And heat is a byproduct of cloud storage. It&apos;s estimated between three to seven kilowatt-hours of energy are needed for every gigabyte of information transferred and stored. To put that into context, watching about two minutes of 4K video is the same amount of energy that&apos;s required to power your phone for one year. And if we are continuing to back up this information, as we are encouraged to do, the heat expenditure could increase exponentially, moving into the future. KF: Now data centers combat these thermodynamic challenges by relying on cooling mechanisms, kind of like air conditioners, but they take up around 40 percent of their energy demands. And because of this, their energy footprint is greater than the airline industry&apos;s as a whole. CK: Imagine how much energy was required by the entire US alone. KF: Funny you should ask, Clifford. The data industry requires approximately 200 terawatt-hours annually and with the combination of smart devices, like phones, watches and personal computers, it accounts for two percent of global CO2 emissions. But here&apos;s the kicker. With the introduction of GPUs and large language models, and deep learning, heat emissions from data centers are poised to surpass the fossil fuel industry as the number one contributor to the climate crisis in our lifetimes. But there&apos;s a better way. DNA. After all, life has been storing information in the organisms&apos; genomes for billions of years, and storing text, images and videos is nothing new. CK: Working off the research by Daniel Gibson, a monumental study in 2017, led by Seth Shipman and Joe Davis, showed the world that we can put a video into the genome of a bacteria. They showed us that every image pixel can be represented by a unique RGB color code. KF: And that color code can be ciphered into the genetic code, and those sequences can be inserted into the noncoding portion of an organism&apos;s genome, using genome editing techniques that many of you are familiar with. CK: And all we need to do to access this information at a later time is to sequence the genes that hold that information and cipher it back into the pixeled image. And we see the potential of this research, and we want to expand beyond just single-cellular organisms like bacteria, and move into multicellular organisms, multicellular organisms like sugarcane. KF: What once was a symbol of colonialism across our islands, can now be viewed as a symbol for a more sustainable future. CK: If you&apos;re not catching the colonial reference there, let us remind you of some of the history. In 1893, a group of American sugarcane plantation owners illegally overthrew the Hawaiian Kingdom, in part to avoid tax import on sugar production, leaving behind 131 years of illegal occupation and systemic oppression across our islands. KF: And for many of us Hawaiians, sugar has left a bitter taste in our mouths. CK: But we want to reshape this narrative and take back agency by putting data into the very thing that nearly wiped out our people. Additionally, we see sugar as something that is beyond just a way to decolonize the data industry, but also a way to show something practical. Its genome is enormous, and it has multiple genes within it. KF: Which theoretically is great for data storage, duplication and integrity. Imagine storing over 200,000 terabytes of information in a single gram of DNA. CK: And you would think with this sort of technology, we&apos;d be out there planting acres and acres of these sugar drives, like those greedy fuckers of the past. (Laughter) But we think we have something different. We want to do it differently. KF: We believe that sugar drives are just a small part of the solution. We’re also exploring other Indigenous varieties of breadfruit, coconut and other microbiota. We have an ambitious dream of revitalizing Indigenous land systems that double as biological data centers. CK: And we hope everyone remembers that indigeneity is just not about being native peoples. It&apos;s about understanding the unique roles that multiple species have within our ecosystem. KF: All of us come from unique places with a tremendous amount of native species. Collectively, all of those species help those systems to function better. CK: All of us Indigenous beings have to reckon with the fact that we all must return to the earth, and that MEGA Land is a place where we hope our data can go. KF: Resting on the banks of our town&apos;s largest living estuary, this two-acre parcel of land is a beacon of hope for Indigenous people around the world. CK: What was destined to be another hotel, condominium or marina is now becoming a thriving Indigenous land use center. KF: Here, there exists a tremendous amount of information that can be digitized and stored locally, just like our community&apos;s oral histories, hula and chants. CK: Biodiversity metrics can be taken alongside environmental observations by the people who depend on this area and put into organisms that potentially hold the key to environmental resilience. KF: Data no longer need be taken away from these places and stored in hot, dark, noisy rooms miles away. CK: It can remain connected to the land, like the stories of old and the Indigenous peoples of today. KF: We&apos;re talking about doing something new that we know to be very, very old. CK: And this might not solve the global data storage crisis, but as we move into a future where there&apos;s digital species and AI influencers, we hope that some of the solutions that we so desperately seek aren&apos;t only found in a deep algorithm in some supercomputer, but they might be in a community that is standing in front of you today. (Applause) Oh, you guys are getting crazy. OK. (Applause) But probably the biggest hope, for me at least, of this whole experiment -- (Laughter) Is to one day be able to respond to Keolu&apos;s annoying texts. KF: How were the waves? CK: Take a hike at the MEGA Land, sequence some DNA and see it for yourself. Both: Thank you. (Applause) (Laughter)"

When I watch the news or scroll my feeds, I keep coming back to the same questions. Why, despite all our knowledge and innovation, do problems like poverty and pollution keep plaguing humanity? Why, despite astonishing advances in renewable energy and resource efficiency, is fossil fuel use at an all-time high, as is our global ecological footprint? And why, despite being responsible for the main part of that footprint, have rich countries been experiencing stagnating, if not decreasing, well-being? I&apos;m a sustainability researcher with a background in econometrics, and I believe the answer lies in the fact that solving poverty, caring for nature or fostering well-being is not the ultimate goal of our current economic system. Its goal is growth. Many take this for granted. But growth wasn&apos;t considered a moral goal for most of history. It was only officially measured around the middle of last century through GDP. It then shifted into the core of our economic thinking and from there into policymaking and our collective psyche. Growth became synonymous with progress. Things went fast after that. Extinction rates went up, resource use and waste exploded. Some warned early on about the dangers of exponential growth on a finite planet. In 1972, a team of MIT scientists created a first-of-its-kind world model consisting of over 200 interconnected variables. With it, they analyzed the question I mentioned earlier: why problems like poverty and pollution persist. They published a book on their findings called &quot;The Limits to Growth,&quot; in which they warned that continuing the business-as-usual growth pursuit would lead to societal breakdown, setting in around now. Breakdown doesn&apos;t mean the end of humanity, but a steep decline in well-being nonetheless. The book was a bestseller, but you may have never heard of it. The authors were derided as doomsayers and their message, over time, buried. A few years back, I compared their now decades-old projections with what&apos;s happened since. I found empirical data closely aligning with the model&apos;s business-as-usual scenario, which shows growth grinding to a halt around 2040 or so, followed by steep declines in things like food production and well-being. My analysis also revealed that this breakdown could be avoided by letting go of the growth pursuit and redirecting resources to meet human needs and protect nature directly. This indicates that what we do in the next few years will determine our well-being for the rest of this century. And this now-or-never moment in history is up to us. Technology by itself will not save us, despite aspirational talks of decoupling, the idea that the economy can grow without resource use and pollution growing along with it. There&apos;s no decoupling, certainly not for a full impact on the Earth. Raw materials consumption has been around 1.2 kilograms per dollar GDP for two decades, while biodiversity loss, water scarcity, plastic pollution are all worsening. But even just considering carbon emissions, which per dollar GDP have decreased, sufficient, absolute decoupling, which is what we&apos;d need, is nowhere in the data. Our choice isn&apos;t whether to keep growing or not. It&apos;s whether the end of growth will come by design or disaster. Either we choose our own limits, or we&apos;ll have them forced upon us. Now that humankind has reached global, unparalleled power, “Limits to Growth” confronts us with a question we’ve never faced before: Who do we want to be, and what world do we want to live in? Here&apos;s where &quot;enough&quot; comes in. If I were to describe the mantra we need in the 21st century with one word, it would be &quot;enough.&quot; &quot;Enough&quot; as in &quot;no more.&quot; This is the limit. Say, a planetary boundary. And enough as in &quot;sufficient,&quot; juxtaposing it to this exhausting grind for ever more and instead invoking a notion of sharing, as in &quot;enough for each.&quot; I believe the only realistic plan to avoid breakdown and maintain global well-being lies in this mindset shift from &quot;never enough&quot; to &quot;enough for each.&quot; Change the goal of our economic system from growth to human and ecological well-being. A well-being economy. What would that look like? We have an idea because we already pretend that&apos;s what we have. No vision statement reads: &quot;A world where growth perpetuates at all costs indefinitely.&quot; It talks about how this organization contributes to society, because that&apos;s what we feel it should do. In a well-being economy, business activities, government policies and citizen behavior are aimed at meeting our physical, social and spiritual needs within planetary boundaries. It doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re anti-growth, it just means we&apos;re more selective about it. We differentiate between what should and should not grow, depending on whether it contributes to well-being. This implies different pathways towards a well-being economy for low- and high-income countries. At small material footprints, growth more often correlates with well-being, including through poverty reduction. So poorer countries below their share of Earth’s carrying capacity may still need green growth, economic expansion driven by clean technologies. In richer countries, what has decoupled from growth is happiness, so they can and should focus on reducing ecological footprints to sustainable levels while safeguarding everyone&apos;s livelihood by sharing more equally. Let me stress because I hear this misconception a lot. Decentering growth doesn’t mean shrinking the economy until it crashes. It means reducing our environmental impact to within a safe operating space for life as we know it. That&apos;s not going back to a poorer past. That&apos;s changing the forward direction away from a cliff. We&apos;ll still have houses with fridges, good schools, health care, profitable businesses. We&apos;ll go to jobs and parties. But social norms and economic dynamics will change. We&apos;ll redefine what has value or what work we call productive. With our needs securely met, this trade-off between social and environmental benefits, which we often take as given, dissolves. Sharing more equally means less income and wealth inequality, improving social cohesion and reducing wasteful, conspicuous consumption. Efficiency gains are used to work less instead of produce more. By not pursuing growth at all costs, we can avoid a lot of costs, like all the expenditure on health care and cleanups due to pollution. Moving to a post-growth society isn&apos;t choosing permanent recession. It&apos;s flexing our free will to change our notion of prosperity from ever more to better. How probable is this economic transformation? It&apos;s feasible. That&apos;s half the answer. We know what promotes well-being. In fact, policies like zero tolerance on child poverty or GDP alternatives are exchanged already in WIEGO, a partnership of self-proclaimed well-being governments. Dozens of cities are piloting post-growth frameworks to operate within explicit social and environmental boundaries, with practices like universal basic incomes. I love how companies that put people and planet legally above profit generate billions each year. How communities are taking back stewardship of their commons with co-ops and renewable energy, water or food. Or how recent experiments with shorter workweeks for the same pay were so successful that most of those companies made it permanent. We also have the technological capabilities, which will be pivotal, once directed towards the right goal. This redirection is indispensable. But of course, I&apos;m regularly told the techno-optimist argument that it&apos;s not. And I always respond. Let&apos;s say we could replace the dying bee colonies with robot pollinators. Why do that if we can also advance regenerative agriculture, which doesn&apos;t cause insecticide? Why dedicate our innovative powers to tree-planting drones when we can also use that thinking to redesign our economy so that existing forest isn&apos;t cut down? And that brings me to the other half of the answer, to how probable a well-being economy is. It&apos;s promise. We&apos;d have less stuff, but more of what we need. Connection. Maintaining a sense of community and purpose is hard in this current economic system, which treats us as selfish, never satisfied consumers. Research shows we&apos;re not just capable of caring for life, we derive joy and meaning from it. We can&apos;t be truly happy unless those around us thrive too. This economic transformation wouldn&apos;t be a capitulation to grim necessity. We&apos;d want to do it even if we were not facing ecosystem collapse, because a well-being economy fits much better who we want to be and a world we long to live in. So we started with these global problems and found that changing our economic system is imperative, but also feasible. And no sacrifice, but simply a letting go of what&apos;s no longer serving us to find belonging in a post-growth world of embraced interdependence. If that sounds spiritual, that&apos;s what a well-being economy delivers. Physical sufficiency, social abundance and spiritual wealth, including the peace of mind that this prosperity can last. Thank you. (Applause) Logan McClure Davda: Thank you, Gaya. So you spoke tonight about broader economic transformation. But what can we as individuals do? Gaya Herrington: Yes. You have to find your unique influence in the system. So that starts by changing the system&apos;s narrative. We&apos;ve been told the story of separation. We are selfish, violent beings, doomed to exploit our commons, so the best thing we can hope for then is technology to save us. So you would have to start by working from a different narrative: the story of interdependence, in which we are nature. Once our needs are securely met, we rejoice in contributing to this web of life that we&apos;re all part of. So you talk about bringing it back to the personal level. That&apos;s actually very emotional work. It&apos;s deeply personal. But of course, it cannot stay there. So then the next step is to build out this new narrative in the system&apos;s structures. And that very much depends on where you are. If you&apos;re in a corporation, look into regenerative business models. If you&apos;re in government, look into well-being government policies. If you&apos;re an investor, see if you can transition from ESG assessments, which are relative, to the absolute assessments against social foundations and planetary boundaries. If you&apos;re an entrepreneur, look into employee ownership. Everyone, citizens, buy at not-for-profit companies. See if community solar makes sense for you. So there&apos;s so many things that you can do, but it very much depends on where you are. But there is one general piece of advice that I can give, and that&apos;s: work together. And remember that systems change is not linear. People do this very disjointedly at first, and then over time they build connections until a critical minority mass is reached, typically around 25 percent or so. And only then does the majority come along because the system change becomes self-reinforcing. Now there&apos;s no guarantee that that will happen for the economic transformation that I&apos;m proposing, but if it does, it will have been because people like you that are gathered here today contributed to that change in their own unique way. So thank you for listening. LMD: Thank you, Gaya. (Applause)"
548173,paul_cj_taylor_what_are_those_colors_you_see_when_you_rub_your_eyes,Paul CJ Taylor,What are those colors you see when you rub your eyes?,https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_cj_taylor_what_are_those_colors_you_see_when_you_rub_your_eyes,"In the late 1600s, Isaac Newton conducted a series of experiments that broke the two most fundamental rules of eye safety— in one, he stared at the sun, and in the other he stuck a needle under his eyeball. Newton was hoping to better understand the lights and colors that sometimes appear when your eyes are closed. If you&apos;ve ever sat around an evening campfire or, unlike Newton, unintentionally glanced at the sun, you may have noticed illuminated patterns briefly dance along your vision before fading into darkness.  So how do these visual illusions, known as afterimages, form? Inside the retina, specialized cells called photoreceptors take in light and turn it into a signal the brain can understand. Photoreceptors contain thousands of molecules called photopigments,  which are sensitive to particular colors. When a light-photon strikes a pigment, part of the photopigment’s structure, known as chromophore, absorbs the energy by temporarily altering its molecular structure in a process called bleaching. This reconfiguration induces a cascade of chemical reactions that route&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;an electrical pulse to the brain. And once your brain assembles the signals from approximately 200 million photoreceptor cells, you see an image.  So how does this lead to an afterimage? Scientists aren&apos;t quite sure, but a leading theory suggests that photoreceptors may be to blame. Looking at something bright causes many pigments in a photoreceptor to bleach. In this state, photopigments can&apos;t absorb light well and need to regenerate. However, it&apos;s believed that photoreceptor cells momentarily continue to fire and to send signals to the brain, transforming the blazing campfire to a bright pattern as you close your eyes. This is known as a positive afterimage. Positive afterimages normally fade within a few seconds, and, under certain conditions, can be replaced by what is known as a negative afterimage. The original colors appear to be swapped for their approximate complement: blue with yellow, red with cyan, green with magenta. If you fixate on a bright image of a green flower on a yellow background, then glance at a white screen, or close your eyes, you will see a negative afterimage of a magenta flower on a blue background. Scientists are still working to understand the origins of negative afterimages, and there are multiple theories. Some evidence suggests the source lies in the layers of neuronal cells in the retina called ganglion cells, while other research implicates deeper processing in the brain. Another theory suggests the source lies, again, in the photoreceptors. The idea is that certain cells are activated if one color— such as green— is viewed. Meanwhile, other cells that are normally activated by viewing red— green’s complement— are then left deactivated. But if you stare at a green image for an extended period of time, it&apos;s thought that while the activated green cells become fatigued, the red cells are still sensitive to input. As a result, when you look away or close your eyes, the opposing red cells are momentarily more active than the tired green cells, creating the perception of a color that is close to the original color’s complement. But scientists still don’t know for sure. And yet another puzzling visual illusion involves no light or staring at all. Simply rubbing, or like Newton, inadvisably stabbing behind your eye can generate the brief appearance of lights and colors. These are known as pressure phosphenes. Newton hypothesized that the colorful circles of light were caused by the physical bending of his retina. Today, some scientists believe that pressure phosphenes are indeed the result of distortion— that rubbing or poking your eyes physically stretches neurons, bending the photoreceptors out of shape and causing them to fire. But again, the science of phosphenes is far from settled, and there are other ways they can form. For example, during procedures where magnetic pulses are sent into specific parts of the brain, some people, including those with certain types of blindness, report seeing flashes of light. And astronauts, traveling where few others have gone before, often describe seeing similar effects when exposed to cosmic radiation from the Sun and other stars."

(Synth sounds) It&apos;s all around us all the time. (Synth sounds with beats) If it&apos;s carefully designed, we can use it to tap directly into our feelings and evoke a deeper connection to ourselves and the world. (Synths continue) As a group of composers, sound designers, creative technologists and musicologists, my team and I combine all this knowledge to create sound experiences that convey stories and ideas. (Synth sounds continue) We use scientific data as musical scores, translating complex information into a language we can easily understand. We work with field recordings, compose linear and modal music, and use technology to understand, control and generate melodies. (Synths continue) We are merging art, music, technology and science into the field of sound scenography, using the auditory sense to foster an emotional understanding of our world. (Synth sounds continue) So let me take you on a sonic journey of music and code, where ones and zeros are mixed with notes and rhythms and poetry meets science. What you are about to hear is a combination of recordings from nature and our surroundings, data-and-AI-driven music and a lot of human creativity. So relax, and if you feel comfortable, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and listen closely. Allow yourself to feel. (Revolving soundscapes) We begin in the water. (Sounds of surf) (Underwater sounds) Here in the deep, we hear tiny creatures, different textures, or even the contrast between the Atlantic ... (Underwater sounds continue) and the Pacific Ocean. (Quieter underwater sounds) We follow the sounds of seals and bring the elusive song of the harbor porpoise to the range of our human hearing. (Porpoise vocalizations and water sounds) The ocean is speaking to us. (Water sounds and synth music) Let’s move out of the water into dry land, and dig deep into the Earth. (Harsh, booming sounds) (Quieter, grumbling sounds) Countless small animals, like earthworms, grubs and ants, they interact, they communicate and work tirelessly to maintain a perfect ecosystem. (Scratching and digging sounds) Through geophones and soil sensors, we can capture these voices and hear the soil singing to us. (Synth music and scratching sounds) But it’s our human creativity that can interpret, modulate, filter and mix all these recordings with music, creating a tapestry of sound that gives a voice to the complex world hidden under our feet. (Synth music) From here, we take flight high into the sky. (Booming and whooshing sounds) Feel the lightness of traveling through air while enjoying the mystical messages carried by birdsongs. (Synth music and bird vocalizations) Let&apos;s focus our attention on that hermit thrush, as it sings to us. (Birdsong) Within that song is a message, that if we slow it down, we can comprehend. (Synth music) Every bird finds his voice in this intricate orchestration. And while they all play together in perfect harmony, we need to find our place in this acoustic ecosystem. (Synth music and sounds of nature) Let’s keep moving up, into the sky ... (Synth music) through the atmosphere ... (Whooshing sound) into the vast emptiness of space. (Synth vocals) In this abstract place, where there is no sound, we reach only to the power of music to try to make sense out of the relationship between sound and time. (Low warbling and synth vocals) As the sound of a voice, we travel to the center of a black hole and wonder what will happen to us in the presence of this cosmic force. (Layered synth vocals and music) We are being stretched, as our musical body just falls apart. New and old musical concepts collide into a timeless sound mass, leaving all sense of structure behind. (Layered synth vocals and music) We are surrounded by the past, the present and the future, all at the same time, while information and matter lose all their meaning. (Layered synth vocals and music) (Music lowers in volume) It is here, in this emptiness, that we find ourselves traveling to the human imagination, an infinitely magical place, bound only by our creativity. (Vocals, nature sounds and music) (Shifting musical patterns) We hear artificial intelligence making music and envision the potential of new collaborations. (Synth music and synth sounds of nature) Explosions of sounds and melodies remind us of the importance of emotional communication, while simultaneously giving us an idea of the creative process being enhanced by technology. (Synth music and synth sounds of nature) As we return from our journey and rejoin one another in this room, let us embrace the force of human imagination and use sound to connect deeper to ourselves and to others. Let us open ourselves to the transformative power of sound and its contribution to a new emotional understanding of our world. (Synth music ends) Thank you. (Cheers and applause)"

Really fun, right? Well, I believe so. In my practice as a designer, I use data to tell stories. Stories that are anchored in numbers, but actually that are mostly defined by small and qualitative data, which are the ones that can add all of the context and human nuances. But what does that mean? Well, for example, when Google wanted to help people understand the threat of plastic pollution, we designed a micro site where you can drop objects that you use every day, such as a disposable plastic bottle, and see how they break apart into microplastics that pollute the sky and the ocean, making this invisible layer tangible and visceral. Or when the clothing company And Other Stories wanted to communicate about inspiring women, I designed a fashion collection where I showed the achievement of three amazing women scientists into data patterns that are woven and embroidered into the textiles. From a personal level, data is the lens that I use to make sense of the world. I live and breathe data. And I love data so much that one time I used it as a writing language to get to know a new friend across the Atlantic. For one entire year, we&apos;ve been writing to each other every week, but we didn&apos;t use a word of English. We spoke data, sharing the most intimate details of our days and our personalities, such as all of the time that we complained and what it was about, and was it even necessary? Or the &quot;thank yous&quot; that we said and what they were for. And even the time that we argued with our partners. And right now, this full set of 52 and 52 postcards happily lives in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, which is quite nice. Thank you. (Applause) But this mission took on a new meaning when I became sick with a chronic illness. I have been living with long COVID for the past four years. Long COVID, if you&apos;re not familiar, is an umbrella term that is used to describe the various health consequences that some of us have after an acute COVID infection or a COVID reinfection. And an infection-associated illness, like long COVID, can be mild and pass just in a few months, but it can actually be extremely disabling and leave you unable to attend to the basic tasks of your life for years or possibly indefinitely. Since my first COVID infection in 2020, and especially so after my reinfection in 2022, I started to develop constant, debilitating symptoms. These are some pictures that I took at different points in my journey, both at home and in the many medical settings that I&apos;ve been at. At my worst, I was completely housebound and at times fully bed-bound, and for a while I even had to stop working, which has been the hardest for me. As I started to develop these constant undiagnosed symptoms, I, of course, turned to data. Tracking these symptoms every day, such as extreme fatigue, dizziness, heart palpitation, tinnitus, head pressure, nerve pain and more. Tracking them together with the treatments that I was trying, and then biometrics from my smart watch, what I was eating and what I was doing for the day, such as walking or commuting and even my level of stress. And I did that to, hopefully, understand possible correlations and help me and my doctors crack this mystery, but also to keep me sane in moments of deep suffering and uncertainty. And this is just a snapshot of four years of data collection. At a certain point in my journey, I decided that I needed to share the data that I collected with people. In fact, when you read about long COVID, you usually read a list of symptoms that might make a healthy person think, &quot;Well, I&apos;m tired, too, after work.&quot; Or &quot;Well, I have headaches as well.&quot; Or &quot;Yeah, after my last COVID infection I coughed for a couple of weeks,&quot; but I had never seen a thorough account of what it means to live with a debilitating condition like this one on a daily basis. I had the opportunity to share my story with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the form of a visual op-ed. When I used the language of paint and data visualization to share my journey day after day. The piece starts with warm-color brushstrokes that surround the title &quot;1,374 Days: My Life with Long COVID.&quot; As you start reading my essay in words, you see that the brushstrokes interact with the text. Understanding without a legend that every different color brushstrokes represent different symptoms, and seeing that the symptoms aggregate by days. As you keep reading a stack of different bloodwork and health tests, just a sample of the many I&apos;ve had, pile up on screen, and then a body figure appears and gets overwhelmed with all the different types of symptoms that I&apos;ve experienced over the past four years. Here is where my spreadsheet, my data diary of sorts, shows up. And as you keep reading, you encounter additional symbols for the hundreds of doctor&apos;s appointments, the dozens of medications I&apos;ve tried, my hospitalizations, and ultimately, the tens of thousands of dollars that I spent for my care. And finally, you piece it all together when you encounter a visual calendar of my year. The calendar gets filled with all these brush strokes and the additional symptoms, and then you&apos;ll see an addition of handwritten annotation that can help you understand what was happening, my vaccinations and my reinfections. Ultimately, seeing that the calendar of our lives changed drastically and dramatically after we got COVID. Now, this is the detailed story of my journey, but I always wanted to include other people&apos;s experiences. And so I asked members of the long-COVID community that I connected with online to respond to one prompt. “I hope that I will be able to  ‘blank’ again.” And at the end of the piece you read hundreds of heart-wrenching hopes from people that hope to be able to walk their dogs again, to play with their children, to get back to work, and simply to live a life that is free and independent. Ultimately concluding with a collective hope that we can all start living with a blank canvas, full of possibility once again. The response to the piece has been incredible. I received thousands of messages from people sick with different chronic illnesses and caregivers that, in different ways, told me that they finally feel seen, that they now have a visible, striking and emotional evidence to send to their loved ones to make them understand what they&apos;re really going through. Data. If we look at them and represent them for what they are, which are human and nuanced representations of our lives, data can move us profoundly. Data can shape human narratives that can open conversations, convey empathy, and even connect people. As for me, you might be asking, ten months after the publication of the essay, I am doing much better. I am not cured, I still have limitations, a few setbacks, and I still take a fair amount of daily medication and prescribed supplements. But I am starting to paint a different picture for myself. Now this is my own story. I am no medical expert, and I don&apos;t aim to speak for the long-COVID community at large. But here&apos;s what I have done. Earlier this year, I decided to shift focus completely. I started a new data collection, one that is only about progress, where the categories in my spreadsheets are only what I have been able to do, such as walking to the subway or trying a few minutes of physical activity without any consequence. Of what I&apos;ve been grateful for for the day, such as a dinner out with my partner and the few moments that I felt really good in my body. I have retired my smart watch, which, truthfully, was giving me more bad than good news every day, and I have stopped logging and therefore paying constant attention and giving meaning to my symptoms. In the beginning it felt scary. I felt almost naked, dropping this built habit of monitoring my body so closely, something that gave me a semblance of control, and also something that made me who I have been for the past four years. But I realized something. That changing how I look at things also changes how things look. Dropping the need to observe my symptoms and shifted my focus has reshaped the way that I see my journey. Now, I want to make clear that the last thing that I want is for people to think that these illnesses are all in our heads, or that positive thinking alone can fix them. That is simply not true. This new approach is part of a program based on solid neuroscience called brain retraining. Every day, like thousands of other people, I&apos;ve been putting in hours to retrain my brain to react differently to symptoms and triggers. And this approach followed the principle of neuroplasticity, which is our brain&apos;s amazing ability to rewire itself, something that can help reduce symptoms and improve the life of people with chronic illnesses. This new approach and this new data collection have been giving me hope, something that I have missed for a long, long time. Almost a year ago, at the end of my essay, I also shared my hope at the time. It reads, &quot;I hope that I will be able to take walks again, to snowboard, to sit at a restaurant and eat with my friends, to travel to my home country, to be pain-free and simply enjoy a day in the sun without symptoms or fear. I hope that one day I will get back to the person that I used to be.&quot; And I am happy to report that I am on track for most of that. The snowboarding part is still a bit out there, but I will be taking a plane to go to Italy, my home country, for the first time in years in two days after this talk, which I&apos;m really excited about. Thank you. (Applause) I believe there is a bigger message here. The world is made of data. But not the data that we produce with our smartphones or credit cards. It&apos;s made of the data that we decide to give our attention to at any given time. Because what you choose to see shapes who you will become and ultimately your entire world. I believe in my recovery now. It might be far away in time, it might have bumps in the road, but firmly believing that it can happen and choosing to look at it over and over despite the obstacles is the first step in that direction. I know that for sure now. Thank you. (Applause)"

But while his disciples loved their roguish leader, his misadventures had spread chaos throughout the land. The Jade Emperor, watching from his throne in Heaven, decided he would no longer stand by as this monkey wreaked havoc across his domain. After consulting with his aide,  the Emperor decided the best way to maintain order was to keep a close eye on Sun Wukong. So, he invited the Monkey King to serve as supervisor of the imperial stables. Sun Wukong jumped at what he thought was a prestigious job in Heaven. He began working diligently to care for Heaven’s horses, and for a time, the Emperor’s plan appeared to be working. But eventually, Sun Wukong realized his job was the lowest rank imaginable. Deeply offended, he whipped out his shapeshifting staff and transformed it into an iron cudgel. Blasting his way back to Earth, he erected a great banner proclaiming the job title he felt entitled to. Furious, the Emperor dispatched his heavenly troops to bring the Monkey King back under control. But even his army’s shapeshifting general was no match for Sun Wukong. Using his guile, the Monkey King bested his opponents, and the Jade Emperor was forced to offer him the post he desired. He reinstated Sun Wukong in Heaven, this time in an opulent mansion. From his new home, the Monkey King threw himself into a life of leisure— exploring the realms and socializing with various deities. But the Jade Emperor was still concerned about his guest’s chaotic nature. To keep him busy, he asked Sun Wukong to protect the sacred Garden of Immortal Peaches. At this task, the Monkey King failed spectacularly. But gorging on fruit did keep him occupied... until he spotted fairies collecting the peaches for a Grand Festival. Despite his official role, Sun Wukong hadn’t been invited to the celebration, and he quickly hatched a plan to get his revenge. Transforming a few of his hairs into sleep-inducing insects, the Monkey King incapacitated the Emperor’s servants and consumed the entire feast himself. Bloated with food and wine, Sun Wukong stumbled towards his mansion. But in his drunken stupor, he ended up at the palace of the Daoist leader Laozi. Sun Wukong giddily explored Laozi’s deserted home, and in the alchemical room, he found a particularly tempting treasure: five gourds filled with golden elixir. Sensing the medicine was sacred, he vowed only to sneak a taste— but soon he was surrounded by empty vessels. The elixir instantly sobered him up, and suddenly Sun Wukong knew he’d gone too far. To avoid Laozi’s legendary wrath, he caught the nearest cloud back to Earth. But it didn’t take long for the Emperor to uncover his trail of chaos. Vowing to subdue Sun Wukong once and for all, he called on his nephew Erlang Shen. Erlang Shen was known throughout the realms for his heroic feats and ability to see through any illusion. He and Sun Wukong began a great battle, transforming into all manner of beasts in their attempts to best one another. The fight was fearsome, but Sun Wukong’s quick wits kept him one step ahead— until Laozi’s bracelet struck him from the heavens. This stumble was all Erlang Shen needed to capture the Monkey King and deliver him to Laozi. The religious leader imprisoned Sun Wukong in a white-hot brazier, cooking him for 49 days. But when Laozi opened the lid, a pair of burning eyes stared back at him. The golden elixir had made Sun Wukong’s body indestructible, and he rose from the pot stronger than ever. At this terrifying triumph, the Jade Emperor despaired. He’d tried tricking, appeasing, and battling Sun Wukong— but it had only led to more chaos. It seemed that only the greatest power in the world could defeat the Monkey King— it was time for Buddha himself to intervene."
547987,eric_nuzum_why_don_t_vampires_cast_reflections_oct_2024,Eric Nuzum,Why don’t vampires cast reflections?,https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_nuzum_why_don_t_vampires_cast_reflections_oct_2024,"We&apos;re here today to hear compelling ideas, new innovations and thinking in science and medicine. And innovative solutions to our most vexing problems in society. So they said to me, &quot;Eric, do you have anything that you can add to this compelling list of stories and ideas? Something you can talk about here on the TED stage?&quot; And I said, &quot;Of course I do.&quot; And the question I want to explore with you today is: Why don’t vampires cast reflections in mirrors? (Laughter) So, you&apos;ve probably seen this before in movies. The humans are suspicious of the new dark stranger, and they band together in this moment of confrontation, and they open up a mirror in front of them and bam -- there’s no reflection there. Proving to the humans that the new dark stranger is, in fact, a vampire. That&apos;s right. So where did this start? How did this happen? This idea that you could hold a mirror up to an undead creature and learn that they are a vampire? Well, we&apos;re going to find that out. The thing you have to keep in mind is, as we look through the history of vampires, that they change over time. Every culture in history has had a variation on a vampire. Every single one. Very few of them use -- Are you laughing at some of these illustrations? Maybe you are. I did sneak one in there. So they don&apos;t always call them vampires. But every culture has a version of a supernatural creature who comes back from the dead and gains power by preying on the living. Our version of the vampire really came about in the 16th century. It was a way to conveniently explain some misunderstandings about death and dying. Some sketchy activity happens in the village. Someone gets an idea, &quot;Hey, let&apos;s dig up Wolfgang.&quot; And they opened his coffin, and they find that his hair and his fingernails and his teeth have all seemed to grow since he died. And they see some fluid around his mouth which they mistakenly think is blood. Proof that Wolfgang is a vampire. But this is actually what happens to a body when it&apos;s decomposing. Not that they&apos;re undead. Our understanding of vampires really exploded, or our lexicon for vampires really exploded in the 18th century after a rabies outbreak in Hungary and Romania. Now, the thing to remember is that when a human contracts rabies, it can take a couple weeks before symptoms start to manifest. So some really common vampire characteristics, like an avoidance of bright lights or strong smells like garlic, an aversion to water and suddenly aggressive behavior are not signs of the undead. They are signs of rabies. But back then, they couldn&apos;t put those things together. They didn&apos;t think that the neighbor who&apos;s acting funny now, it wasn&apos;t because of the raccoon that bit them two weeks ago. It&apos;s because now a much more logical explanation is that they are, in fact, a vampire. (Laughter) So most of our ideas of vampires that we all think of came about in the movies. Count Dracula and Sherlock Holmes have been in a decades-long battle to be the most depicted fictional character in film. It goes back and forth every couple of years. But when we think of the vampire in film, there are some things that are quite iconic to us, like &quot;Nosferatu,&quot; right? Here&apos;s a fun fact for you about &quot;Nosferatu.&quot; Outside of that, most people get something wrong, they think it&apos;s the first vampire movie. It wasn&apos;t, but it was the first one that was anything like approaching a hit. The fun fact I want to share with you is that every copy of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; that any of us have ever seen is an illegal bootleg. Bram Stoker’s widow, sued the filmmakers for copyright infringement. She was worried that &quot;Nosferatu&quot; was going to cut into the quite lucrative royalties from the stage version of &quot;Dracula&quot; that was being performed in the UK and the US. She won that lawsuit, and in her settlement, she demanded that every copy of the film be destroyed. Most people, when they think of vampires, think of the 1931 Tod Browning classic starring Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula. You almost can&apos;t overstate how huge a movie this was. It not only really established vampire movies, it started a vampire movie trend that lasted for over two decades. It was the first mainstream hit that was a horror film. It really established horror as a genre in film and set up expectations for, like, even “Frankenstein,” that came later that same year. Since this whole craze of vampires really started with Dracula, we&apos;ve had so many, hundreds of variations on the vampire. We have had samurai vampire, we have had plumber vampires, we have had vampire babies, we have had stripper vampires. We&apos;ve had a vampire movie about every member of Dracula&apos;s extended family. Son of Dracula, daughter of Dracula, father of Dracula, bride of Dracula. We&apos;ve even had Dracula&apos;s dog in &quot;Zoltan, Hound of Dracula.&quot; (Laughter) There is one definitive thing I can tell you about vampire movies, and that is, vampire movies suck. (Laughter) And I&apos;m not being metaphorical here. Vampire movies are not good movies. (Laughter) So why is this? Why is it that these movies don&apos;t really last very long? It&apos;s because we keep changing our idea of what terrifies us and what scares us. You know, speaking of things in common, there&apos;s one thing that vampire movies do not have in common. Does anyone want to guess what vampire movies do not have in common? Vampires. It became such a hot trend for vampire movies that people would slip the word vampire into the title, even though there wasn&apos;t a vampire in the movie. There&apos;s multiple ones of these. The the most notorious of these was the 1952 stinker called &quot;My Son the Vampire,&quot; which did star a late-career Bela Lugosi. But he didn&apos;t play a vampire, and no one else in the cast did either. But they figured it would be a big trend and get in on a big trend and did this. So not even this happened. I often get asked, what is the best vampire movie I&apos;ve ever seen and the worst vampire movie I&apos;ve ever seen? And it may surprise you to learn that the best vampire movie I&apos;ve ever seen, and the worst vampire movie I&apos;ve ever seen are the same film. (Laughter) &quot;Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter.&quot; (Laughter) So we know a lot about Jesus, right? But somehow history has forgotten that Jesus of Nazareth is apparently also a kung fu master. (Laughter) And in this movie, Jesus comes back to Earth to save the world and humanity from a vampire cult who has taken over. And he uses his kung fu skills to do this. And one more little tidbit, &quot;Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter&quot; is also a musical. (Laughter) So, just for your enjoyment, I did bring along the trailer to this great piece of cinema. (Video) In the new millennium, vampires no longer fear the sun. Now they&apos;re going to learn it&apos;s time to fear the Son of God. (Music) Live to fight. Right to live. Live to fight. Right to live. Phil Caracas is &quot;Jesus Christ, Vampire Hunter.&quot; (Applause) I am assuming that you&apos;re all in some state of stun after seeing that. So let me give you a real quick recap of what you saw. You saw Jesus riding a Vespa, then you saw Jesus getting his hair cut, then you saw Jesus kicking some holy ass. And you also saw El Santo, the famed Mexican masked wrestler, who is in the film and plays Jesus&apos;s sidekick. So I think we&apos;ve established over the last several minutes that there are many colors in the vampire rainbow. So let&apos;s not get too far away from our original point. Why don&apos;t vampires, in all these bad films, bad novels, bad stories, why do none of them ever cast reflections in mirrors? I mean, there are not one but several vampire tales where the vampires are deathly scared of uncooked rice. Yeah, true. Count von Count from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; is based off of the idea that vampires are obsessed with counting. And if they see sand or rice on the ground, they&apos;re going to have to stop and count every grain, the sun comes up and they die. There you go. A little improvised little bit for you right there. So now see if I can find my place back into what I&apos;m talking about. So if you want the answers to why they don&apos;t cast reflections in mirrors, the answer is that there really isn&apos;t a clear answer to this question. The consensus thinking is that when you hold -- it comes from the habit or something people did of holding a mirror up to a deceased person&apos;s face to see if the warm breath would fog up the mirror. And if you think about it, if someone&apos;s lying prone and you hold a mirror up to their face, what you&apos;re going to see in that mirror is the wall. You&apos;re not going to see them. Therefore no reflection in the mirror. But I think there&apos;s actually a far simpler answer than this. When you look at vampires and how they change over time, what was once terrifying and evil becomes dull and campy. We change the vampire to match our time. In the 1890s, Bram Stoker&apos;s &quot;Dracula,&quot; the novel, was thought to be an allegory for the end of Victorian morals. In 1931, when &quot;The Dracula,&quot; starring Bela Lugosi, came out, the idea was that that represented a fear of eastern European immigration. In the 1950s, vampire films represented a fear of communism. We morph the vampire to match our time. So with this, why don&apos;t vampires cast reflections in mirrors? I think it&apos;s because the vampire is the reflection. They are a reflection of us. They are a reflection of what we fear. They are a reflection of what we consider to be unchecked power without accountability. They are our idea of the ultimate villain that lies almost undetectable, until someone holds a mirror up to them. All our talks today are themed around unity, the idea that when we come together, we are stronger. I would argue that it&apos;s not only about the things that we share in common as far as beliefs and things that we believe, but also the darker things that unite us. When I know what you fear, when I know what goes bump in your night, perhaps I can help protect you. Perhaps we can help protect each other. There are so many vampires in the world today. Vampire. Vampire. Vampire. (Laughter) Vampire. Vampire. Vampire. Vampire. Vampire. Vampire. So when I originally put this talk together, there was a picture here. And the TEDx people said, &quot;Maybe you should take that picture of a politician out.&quot; (Laughter) And I will leave it to you to figure out what politician&apos;s picture I just might have put in there in a list of vampires. Maybe better yet, I could ask what politician wouldn&apos;t be put in a list of vampires? But I want to leave you with this. One thing that I see in so many vampire stories is the thing that brings about the monster&apos;s decline is when the humans, who are weak and powerless individually, come together and unite, and they prevail. It&apos;s a concept called unity. (Applause)"

I think for me, social media is one of those places and safe havens. Social media can be a positive change. It can inform masses about really crucial issues that are often overlooked in the media. My followers often are commenting on my videos saying, &quot;I haven&apos;t seen this anywhere else.&quot; I think that social media can save lives when used in the right way. My name is Joel Bervell, I&apos;m a fourth-year medical student, but I&apos;m better known online as a medical mythbuster for creating content about health equity, the hidden history of medicine and the ways that healthcare needs to change for communities of color. When I first started medical school, it was a really interesting time. I was thinking a lot about Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. All these moments were happening at the same time that I entered my first year of medical school, where myself and one other medical student were the only two Black medical students in our school of 200 students. It made me think a lot about how we were talking about race in the United States and what race meant in the context of being a medical student. I kept hearing in my classes that Black people were more likely to have asthma, more likely to get COVID, Black people were more likely to have diabetes. We never dived into the social or other political ramifications of why that was and the history behind what led to those health disparities to exist. Seeing the lack of diverse medical education in my curriculum made me want to actually take to TikTok and Instagram to talk about the things that I wasn&apos;t seeing in school. (Video) My name is Joel, the medical mythbuster. And let&apos;s talk about racial bias with the alpha-fetoprotein test. Let&apos;s talk about racial biases in lung function tests. Let’s talk about the racialization of X-ray radiation. The misguided racial correction built into this device, spirometer, it assumes that all Black and Asian patients have a lower lung functioning compared to any other race. Up to 93 percent of cervical cancers are preventable. Yet in the United States, Latinos are more likely to be diagnosed with it, and Black women are more likely to die from it. Looking back at this history teaches us is how racism becomes embedded and unnoticed until we raise the alarm to practices that make no sense. [&quot;When you go to medical school to learn how to heal people] [but also learn that racial biases still exist in medicine.] [So you start using social media to expose the racial biases and educate everyone]  So many of my videos, a lot of the comments were from healthcare professionals: doctors, nurses, PAs, saying, &quot;I&apos;ve never heard about this.&quot; A study in 2016 was done and actually showed that 50 percent of medical students or residents endorse at least one false biological belief about differences between Black and non-Black patients. So goes to show how the history of these biases and stereotypes continue till today and can impact the way that patients get care. Because everyone, especially most Black people, have had an experience in the hospital where they felt like they weren&apos;t listened to, they were ignored, and they want to understand why. There&apos;s already legacies and histories of why communities of color don&apos;t trust the medical system. You can look at so many things that have been done. (Video) In 1961, Fannie Lou Hamer went to the hospital for the removal of a small uterine tumor. While under anesthesia, she was given a hysterectomy without consent. This woman&apos;s cells were used for research on COVID, polio, cancer and so much more, but they were taken without her consent. Dr. Sims practiced genital surgeries on enslaved Black women and children without any anesthesia. Our job as physicians needs to be to be able to figure out what should and what shouldn’t stand from past beliefs to present beliefs. I think diversity, equity, inclusion is one way that we&apos;re able to critically evaluate the systems around us, especially in medicine. Diversity, equity, inclusion one, is really important because it goes beyond race. It goes to thinking about all aspects of our social identities and how that interacts with the healthcare field. And two, it&apos;s necessary just because the patient population we serve is diverse in itself. So often there are places in medicine where it doesn&apos;t make sense to use race. Whether that&apos;s through an equation that&apos;s about kidney functioning or about lung functioning. So being able to talk about DEI in that lens allows us to critically evaluate why we use race-specific issues. If we&apos;re not able to accurately critique why race is included in systems, and whether that&apos;s harming or helping patients, we&apos;re unable to do our job of do no harm. But there&apos;s a concerted effort to try and essentially root diversity, equity, inclusion out of medicine, people thinking that&apos;s negative in the medical field. If these anti-DEI bills continue to get passed, I think we&apos;re going to see less diversity in medicine across the spectrum. I think we&apos;re going to see less access to research that&apos;s really critically thinking about why we&apos;re using race and being able to kind of recorrect that, which has already been difficult to get people to talk about in the first place. We&apos;re going to see scholarship programs dry up. We&apos;re going to see programs that are investing in the next generation go away. We&apos;re going to see students less interested in going into medicine, simply because there&apos;s not investments into communities that have been overlooked for so long. We&apos;re going to be set back to a time where we were not moving medicine forward and actively harming patients. I don&apos;t want to scare people away from the health care system, but I want them to know that they have the power and there&apos;s information they can have when they get to the doctor so they feel a little bit more confident. When there&apos;s awareness, providers, patients, researchers can actually start tackling a problem. I think when we don&apos;t know it&apos;s a problem, we don&apos;t do anything about it. I think there&apos;s just so many opportunities to use social media as this ground for community to build and create advocacy and hopefully create change. I think especially when it comes to anti-DEI bills, I think that&apos;s the space we&apos;re going into. It can be a space to continue to learn, educate and hopefully talk about how we can improve medicine overall."
