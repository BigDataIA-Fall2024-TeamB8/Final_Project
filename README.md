# Background
TED Talks are a great way to learn since they provide insightful thoughts from speakers on a range of subjects. Without particular searches, users may have trouble finding the correct content, and there are no tools to compare ideas from different lectures or customize insights. Additionally, the platform is devoid of interactive features like conversational browsing and methods for converting insights into practical actions. Because of these restrictions, viewers find it challenging to properly interact with and implement the information presented in TED Talks, highlighting the need for a more customized and interactive platform.

# Problem Statement:
In the modern world, TED lectures provide a variety of information, but viewers frequently struggle to select necessary lectures, customize the insights to suit their own requirements, and apply the knowledge to real-world situations. This undermines the platform's effect and use.
